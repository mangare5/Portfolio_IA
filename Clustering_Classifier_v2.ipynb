            "tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems  plasma high-definition tvs  and digital video recorders moving into the living room  the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years  time.  that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend  programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks  through cable  satellite  telecoms companies  and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.  one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes  like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system  allow people to record  store  play  pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.  essentially  the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets  which are big business in japan and the us  but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts  they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules  putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as  brand identity  and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment  it is also a concern that is being raised in europe  particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+.  what happens here today  we will see in nine months to a years  time in the uk   adam hume  the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc  there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters  but brand loyalty is important for everyone.  we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands   said tim hanlon  from brand communications firm starcom mediavest.  the reality is that with broadband connections  anybody can be the producer of content.  he added:  the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.   what this means  said stacey jolna  senior vice president of tv guide tv group  is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks  in us terms  or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future  instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone  the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands  mr hanlon suggested.  on the other end  you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them   said mr hanlon.  ultimately  the consumer will tell the market they want.   of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces  many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them  instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies  directtv  has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability  instant replay  and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo  called tivotogo  which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want  when they want.\n"

            "chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters warning the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election. the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour. to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative s record in government he said: i give you this promise - with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation 15% interest rates £3bn in lost reserves 250 000 repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. never again tory boom and bust. this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by 2008 £60bn more. turning to the economy the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power. he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto he said. and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers initiative. in the speech which prompted a standing ovation he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world s poorest countries a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech shadow chief secretary to the treasury george osborne said: this was more talk from gordon brown. we ve heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown. liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it. for all his trumpeting of labour s management of the economy gordon brown s record is very mixed he said. gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy a system which subjects millions of people to means testing and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. for all his positive words gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation. also in gateshead the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign. mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible but not before the job was done. he also said he wanted to carry on as pm because i still think that there are big changes our country needs .blair to face trust issue head on tony blair says he will be facing the issue of trust and his own integrity head on during the election campaign. during a question and answer session with first-time voters on five news mr blair said he had no option but to confront it by talking to people. he also dismissed claims government plans to get 50% of young people into university would devalue degrees. he was not forcing anyone to go to university but places should be there for those who wanted them he said. in answer to a question from 22-year-old liverpool student david dunne about concerns over the prime minister s personal integrity mr blair said talking was the only answer. you ve just got to confront it and say to people let s have a discussion on the things that worry you the things that make you say i can t trust you or i am against you on this. the worst thing in politics was that the electorate only got little snatches of policy from things like prime minister s questions and the news headlines. this was why he wanted to get out of the 30 seconds on the news he added. by talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them even if they did not agree with them he said. mr blair also faced questions about british policy on iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme. he insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: sometimes people say because of what has happened in iraq this is the next place. instead there was a real chance of a peaceful resolution to the problem he said.blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation. the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a fair summary of lord goldsmith s opinion. that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue saying it had been dealt with literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being leaned on and says the words written were his. the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence told the bbc on friday: that as a general rule is right but it s not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added: we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers advice to the government has been published. and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. this is argument was rejected by mr blair who said: firstly we haven t broken the precedent and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it. in a book published this week philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code. my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee summon the attorney get all the papers out look at exactly what happened she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday lord goldsmith said his statement had not been written by or at number 10 . in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003 i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions he said.wilkinson fit to face edinburgh england captain jonny wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against edinburgh on saturday. wilkinson who has not played since injuring his bicep on 17 october took part in full-contact training with newcastle falcons on wednesday. and the 25-year-old fly-half will start saturday s heineken cup match at murrayfield on the bench. but newcastle director of rugby rob andrew said: he s fine and we hope to get him into the game at some stage. the 25-year-old missed england s autumn internationals after aggravating the haematoma in his upper right arm against saracens. he was subsequently replaced as england captain by full-back jason robinson. sale s charlie hodgson took over the number 10 shirt in the internationals against canada south africa and australia. wilkinson s year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the world cup final.howard dismisses tory tax fears michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest. he defended the package saying it was a plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further. the tories on monday highlighted £35bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats say the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party s mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted. tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times: i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts. interviewed on bbc radio 2 s jeremy vine show mr howard said: it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts. on the other side there are people who say we won t be able to achieve these tax cuts. i think we have got it about right. mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. he added: i would like to be able to do more and over time i am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget. i have got to be responsible about this. the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in may - gathered pace. the liberal democrats launched their pre-election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees. lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as fantasy economics . labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus . the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.ask jeeves tips online ad revival ask jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes. the firm s revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004 exceeding $86m (£46m). ask jeeves once among the best-known names on the web is now a relatively modest player. its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival google earlier in the week. during the same quarter yahoo earned $187m again tipping a resurgence in online advertising. the trend has taken hold relatively quickly. late last year marketing company doubleclick one of the leading providers of online advertising warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. but on thursday it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. neither ask jeeves nor doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news however. in both cases their shares fell by some 4%. analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of google on tuesday.johnny cash manager holiff dies the former manager of johnny cash saul israel holiff has died at the age of 79 his family said. mr holiff who was also a concert promoter managed cash s career between 1960 and 1973 quitting when he thought the singer s career had peaked. i was guilty for underestimating him repeatedly he once said. the canadian music manager who also managed tommy hunter and the statler brothers had been in declining health according to his family. an entrepreneur from an early age mr holiff served as a rear air gunner in the royal canadian air force during world war ii afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant. he briefly dabbled in acting before setting up offices in nashville and los angeles for his concert and artist promotion business. in 1970 rpm weekly magazine presented holiff with a special award as the canadian music industry s man of the year. mr holiff retired when he was in his late 40s returning to education as a mature student at the university of victoria where he graduated with a degree in history. he passed away on 17 march. according to his wishes there will be no funeral service.holmes starts 2005 with gb events kelly holmes will start 2005 with a series of races in britain. holmes will make her first track appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold in january s norwich union international in glasgow. she will also run in the grand prix in birmingham in february and may defend her indoor aaa 800m title in sheffield earlier that month. i am still competitive and still want to win she said. i m an athlete and i can t wait to get back on the track. she added: these events are also a great opportunity to thank the british public for the enormous levels of support they have given me from the moment i stepped off that plane from greece. the glasgow meeting will see holmes compete over 1500m in a five-way match against sweden france russia and italy.roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold. recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in 1991. he-man and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s will soon receive their own costly makeovers. with screen versions of the a-team the dukes of hazzard and even blake s seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business. but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung! in the us replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished computer-generated animation. in a similar fashion the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original s puppets and models. the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song. but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site. and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention. i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. but i think it s backfiring. what s next - the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment. after the success of garfield: the movie britain s shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle. with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ. furry recyclers have already had one big-screen outing - 1977 s wombling free. but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc s supernatural comedy . and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv s most popular cartoon buccaneer . it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed. the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february. how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money! thundercats!! i loved it. should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back! get your hands off the clangers! is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits! what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy. you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse! but then again it couldn t be better than the original series could it it s always nice to see these old toons re-released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off. just leave these classics alone as good memories. i think remakes are a good idea. as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular. as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes. leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson. love to see transformers with real actors and cgi. and make it at least a 15 rating. part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. they were moody sarcastic and rather human. just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. dougal never smiled like that! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place. i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. it s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two. it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation. it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film-makers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever. i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child. there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate. we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new. it got to be mr.benn. the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin. if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character. muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know! why can t the british film industry try making gerry anderson s ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people. in today s media it seems the past is the future. tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music. even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more! why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone. mary mungo and midge. but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasn t even there! i d like to see mr. benn with brad pitt in the title role. sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner. it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr. benn with rowan atkinson as the lead. would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn t come up to scratch. the only one that isn t to be remade as yet is thundercats which i d like to see. i m an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children s programs for my 2 daughters. my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen!! very scandinavian... rainbow! i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it s original witty and modern. the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago. how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!! if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! i don t care! till then i ll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert. i d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children s programme. could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm i could go on and on. danger mouse at 34 i m showing my age. :-) noggin the nog was one of the best children s programs. the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate s wonderful voices. so in general leave well alone. the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story. just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks. in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo. will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall. one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90. it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car. of course gerry anderson s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen big-budget action. it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children t movie that really let it down. after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves. it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isn t it i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic. perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mock-authentic style i might be interested ... chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega! this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc. the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. starsky & hutch) hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies. i m only 27 and don t remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it s a classic. the fact it s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today s stuff it looks amateurish. thats the appeal though it s so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.us to raise tv indecency fines us politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on us tv. fines of up to $500 000 (£266 582) could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities. the proposal unveiled in the house of representatives also seeks to revoke a broadcaster s licence after three violations have been committed. the exposure of janet jackson s breast at last year s superbowl landed cbs with a $550 000 (£293 264) fine. entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both us politcians and officials from the federal communications commission (fcc). a republican senator from kansas sam brownbeck is set to call for a maximum $3 million (£1.6 million) fine for repeated violations. the current maximum fine stands at $32 500 (£17 320) - 20 of the stations in the cbs network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the jackson incident. republican politician fred upton who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting said current fines are more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent . last year s janet jackson wardrobe malfunction encouraged the fcc to impose tougher rules but the us congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines. new figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before president bush. certain broadcasters like fox claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech.bryan twins keep us hopes alive the united states kept the davis cup final alive with victory in saturday s doubles rubber leaving spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day. masters cup champions mike and bob bryan thrashed juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo 6-0 6-3 6-2 in front of a partisan crowd in seville. victory would have given spain the title but they were outclassed. in sunday s reverse singles carlos moya takes on andy roddick before rafael nadal faces mardy fish. it feels good but it s not going to be as good if we don t win two tomorrow said mike bryan. it feels good to give those guys another shot and spain has to go to sleep on that. bob bryan added: i m really confident in andy winning that first match and then anything can happen. spain coach jordi arrese chose to rest 18-year-old nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over roddick on friday. he was replaced by former world number one ferrero but the spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world s best doubles teams. the 26-year-old bryan twins have won all four of their davis cup matches this year. and they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the olympic stadium racing through the opening set to love. the spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out. when robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over and the unflappable bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win. ferrero who was upset to be dropped for friday s singles hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. it was a difficult game against the best doubles players he said. they have everything calculated and we had very little to do. i was a bit surprised that i was named to play the doubles match because i hardly play doubles. arrese said: juan carlos hasn t played at all badly. he played the right way but the bryans are great doubles players.clijsters could play aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january s australian open because of her persistent wrist injury. open chief paul mcnamee had said: kim s wrist obviously isn t going to be rehabilitated. but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. but if there s the least risk she will stay away. despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament which begins on 17 january clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. meanwhile jelena dokic who used to compete for australia has opted out of the first grand slam of the season. dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. four-time champion monica seles who has not played since last year s french open is another absentee because of an injured left foot.greek sprinters suspended by iaaf greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. athletics ruling body the iaaf said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were unacceptable . it added that kenteris and thanou had been provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases . they face two-year bans if found guilty by the greek athletics federation. the suspension also covers the athletes controversial coach christos tzekos. kenteris the 2000 olympic 200m champion and thanou the women s 100m silver medallist from the same games in sydney also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed tests. they failed to appear to give samples in chicago and tel aviv shortly before the athens games and again in athens on 12 august the eve of the opening ceremony. greek prosecutors have also charged them with faking a midnight motorcycle crash which led to them spending four days in hospital. some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. wednesday s statement said the greek federation (segas) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations. there will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the greek federation to the court of arbitration for sport the iaaf said. tzekos insisted he and the runners had nothing to hide. the iaaf s decision means nothing he said. we ll be presenting all our arguments to segas - we re innocent.juninho demand for o neill talks juninho s agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with martin o neill as the brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing celtic. brian hassell says no official approach has been received from manchester city but that the english club had been earmarked as a possible destination. but it was being stressed to bbc sport that juninho would prefer to remain with the scottish champions. juninho wants assurances that he will return to o neill s first-team plans. he has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from middlesbrough in the summer. hassel says juninho who has just bought a new home would desperately like to stay at celtic but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted. the agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old s father being in scotland and talk of a move back to botafogo in brazil. juninho s father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. i know there is interest from a brazilian club but i know juninho doesn t want to go there said hassel. he wants to stay in britain. in fact he wants to stay at celtic. hassall made it clear that a move to manchester city who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker was more of a possibility than botafogo or mexican outfit red sharks veracruz who also expressed an interest. it was a thought at one stage he said. if you are not going to get a game under one manager you look for another whose style of play suits you. he is a fan of kevin keegan s style of play. it would not be a bad move for him. juninho had earlier told the daily record: the manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn t happened. if that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. that would be good for the club and good for me. if i have no part in his plans there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes. the attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss martin o neill since his move to celtic park. i can t understand why i am in this situation he continued. when a manager brings a new player to the club he gives that player support.anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament. tories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords. the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects. the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march. the new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently. in a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today: it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned. he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians. mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests he argued.souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen. he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on. michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we re monitoring him he told bbc newcastle. he is a great centre-forward and only 25 but i don t think we re the only ones monitoring the situation at real. souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn s club scoring record may influence the striker s decision. milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness. i can t imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn s scoring record. souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phone-in for bbc newcastle souness said tried to re-sign him but villa were not interested in selling. the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. i m after three four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets he said. don t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `who are we going to target nowconservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards. the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc. the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats. they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it. the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.briton wins short film oscar three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year s oscars were british. for andrea arnold who won the category ashvin kumar and gary mckendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight. arnold s gritty drama wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline while kumar s little terrorist follows a young pakistani muslim boy who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed indian border. mckendry s entry everything in this country must forces british soldiers and catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in northern ireland. last week the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the academy s headquarters in beverly hills. i felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen i ve ever seen says arnold. set in her native dartford wasp tells the story of a young mum who unable to find a babysitter leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she s on a date. the image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby s mouth. the other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. but i just start with an image i can t shake off work outwards from that and see what comes out she explains. since she presented children s tv shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. i m not interested in the publicity. it s not my personality. i m overwhelmed by all the fuss she said. it s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. but even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at sundance last month) i d still be proud of it - even if it hadn t won any. asked what the nomination means to her arnold says she feels flattered and honoured . we ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can t get it in perspective yet. i m still reeling. and she won t commit to an opinion of hollywood yet. i m just in the middle of it living moment to moment day to day. but despite her reservations about the academy awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it she accepts that it has opened doors for her. people will definitely listen to what i want to do now and the phone didn t stop ringing for a week after i got nominated. as for the future arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. you re left more to your own devices without people interfering as much. that said she is currently working on a feature film with dogville and dancer in the dark director lars von trier.labour accused of broken pledge labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card the tories have claimed. home secretary charles clarke has been quoted as telling labour members he wants more migrants to come to the uk. tory co-chairman liam fox said the comments were at odds with tony blair s prediction of a net cut in immigration. but mr clarke accused him of trying to score cheap political points by muddling immigration with asylum. london s evening standard quoted mr clarke telling labour activists at a question and answer session in gateshead that he wanted britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. that s not only a moral duty and a legal duty but something which is part of the essence of this country he said. we want more migration more people come to study and to work. we want more people coming to look for refuge. mr blair s was asked last wednesday if the government s new immigration plans including a point system for economic migrants would reduce net migration. the prime minister told mps: the abusers will be weeded out and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle] the numbers will probably fall. on monday dr fox told reporters: the prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. the labour party election pledges even when they are so incredibly vague do not even last four days. the tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants. mr clarke dismissed the latest tory attack. this is simply a scurrilous attempt by the tories to score cheap political points he said. the tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum. mr clarke said he had made clear the uk would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. and only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall he added. earlier dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about tory policies and then attacking the lies. he told bbc radio: if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all. the latest pre-election spats come after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda which would take britain backwards. lib dem leader charles kennedy accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay.profile: david blunkett before he resigned the position of home secretary on wednesday david blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race policing and immigration. his responsibilities in running the home office included civil emergencies security terrorism and expenditure. named home secretary after the 2001 general election mr blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. the attacks on the world trade center on 11 september 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. a labour loyalist from a working class background mr blunkett 57 had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to labour policy. recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. mr blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister beverly hughes. having received his full backing ms hughes was forced to resign in april over abuses in the visa processing system which she claimed to be unaware of. mr blunkett s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from afghanistan and kosovo to get back home to start rebuilding their countries. and he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a sense of belonging in britain telling them to speak english at home. avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary who spurns a metropolitan elite and airy fairy libertarians and earlier in the year coined the phrase liberati as an amalgam of glitterati and liberal . yet in january of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis from a grade b to grade c status drug . before the recent furore mr blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. mr blunkett told the daily telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring in spite of being a divorcee as a useful way of ensuring that people don t casually think i am available . he added: i am not available because i am just getting on with the job. mr blunkett entered parliament for sheffield brightside in 1987 after first contesting the sheffield hallam seat in 1974. he is one of very few blind mps and was the first to reach the front bench and the cabinet. his relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box in the labour party s national executive and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. mr blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply an inconvenience . using braille for speeches and briefed by his officials on tape he also has a sharp tongue at times and a pragmatic approach to politics. mr blunkett was schooled in sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the commons. he chaired the labour party nationally and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s shadowing health and education. in tony blair s first government mr blunkett was put in charge of education and employment where he won big increases in funds for schools while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. he was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. in the labour party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague a conciliator who avoids factions and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. there have been wry smiles as well. in 1999 his then guide dog lucy threw up in the chamber during the speech of his tory opponent. lucy was replaced by her half-sister sadie a black labrador-curly-coated retriever cross in 2003 after nearly a decade by mr blunkett s side.mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week. the former police chief dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron. mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly. the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. but mr herron - who gained fame as one of sunderland s metric martyrs and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign - said he was not convinced by mr mallon s arguments. the reality is that it is not going to deliver he said. labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. if you can t sell a deal in that time it is a bad deal. on wednesday mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign two-bit tories in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters. the campaign is being run by two-bit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east; they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head he said. mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including he claims tory leader michael howard. most local observers believe the contest is too close to call although little recent polling has been carried out. yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. he added: the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east. the accountability should be in the north east as well. he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaign s alleged political allegiances. we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign - london tory spin doctors. graham robb spokesman for north east says no said the yes campaign s decision to get personal dragged the campaign into the gutter and showed they were rattled . and he hit back at mr mallon s claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region. it can push paper around but it can not get people moving he said. some 487 939 people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. the deadline for voting is next thursday 4 november.pavey focuses on indoor success jo pavey will miss january s view from great edinburgh international cross country to focus on preparing for the european indoor championships in march. the 31-year-old was third behind hayley yelling and justyna bak in last week s european cross country championships but she prefers to race on the track. it was great winning bronze but i m wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season she said. because of previous injuries i don t even run up hills in training. pavey who came fifth in the 5 000m at the athens olympics helped the british cross country team win the team silver medal in heringsdorf last week. she is likely to start her 3 000m season with a race in either boston or stuttgart at the end of january.tate & lyle boss bags top award tate & lyle s chief executive has been named european businessman of the year by a leading business magazine. iain ferguson was awarded the title by us publication forbes for returning one of the uk s venerable manufacturers to the country s top 100 companies. the sugar group had been absent from the ftse 100 for seven years until mr ferguson helped it return to growth. tate s shares have leapt 55% this year boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of its artificial sweeteners. after years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the ftse 100 one of britain s venerable manufacturers has returned to the vaunted index forbes said. mr ferguson took the helm at the company in 2003 after spending most of his career at consumer goods giant unilever. tate & lyle which was an original member of the historic ft-30 index in 1935 operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production facilities in 28 countries. previous winners of the forbes award include royal bank of scotland chief executive fred goodwin and former vodafone boss chris gent.oscar nominees gear up for lunch leonardo dicaprio jamie foxx and hilary swank are among those due to attend this year s oscar nominees luncheon on monday. they will join more than 100 nominees from the 24 oscar categories at the annual event which will take place at the beverly hilton hotel los angeles. british hopefuls including kate winslet imelda staunton and sophie okonedo are also expected to attend. this year s oscar ceremony will be held on sunday 27 february. martin scorsese s the aviator is leading the field at this year s oscars with 11 nominations while other multiple nominees include million dollar baby and sideways. oscar nominees swank and foxx were among the winners at the screen actors guild awards at the weekend one of the many ceremonies held in the run-up to the oscars. swank won best actress for million dollar baby while foxx triumphed for his performance as ray charles in the biopic ray. sideways was also among the winners taking the prize for best cast performance. the next major film award ceremony of the season is the bafta awards which take place at london s odeon leicester square on 12 february. many of those nominated for oscars including dicaprio foxx and staunton - an oscar nominee for her performance in vera drake - have also been nominated for baftas.uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced. the bahamas east timor madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. mr straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism. honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed mostly in europe and america. they include dallas in the us bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal with local staff replacing uk representation in another 11. the changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006 with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. in a written statement mr straw said: the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office s strategic priorities including counter- proliferation counter-terrorism energy and climate change. some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. in africa for instance we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane. the foreign office currently has about 6 100 uk-based staff. it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding wednesday s cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. the shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected he said.beckham rules out management move real madrid midfielder david beckham has no plans to become a manager when his playing career is over. i am not interested in being a coach but i would like to have football schools the england captain said on television station canal plus. i have wanted to do that since i went to the bobby charlton school. i m going to open one in london and one in la. my second passion is charity work - i am an ambassador for unicef and it gives me great pride. but beckham revealed that his immediate priority was winning the spanish league title with real madrid. real slipped to 13 points behind leaders barcelona with a 1-0 defeat at the hands of sevilla on wednesday. beckham admitted: it s disappointing and frustrating to see the results considering the team we have. i would really like to win la liga with real madrid - i have been here two years and we still have not done it. in a wide-ranging interview beckham also revealed that his sending-off against argentina - and the resulting media storm - had been the most significant moment in his career. asked for his worst memory he said: to be sent off against argentina - it was not for the sending-off but for what happened afterwards. i was lucky because i had a manager sir alex ferguson who supported me and a strong family behind me but i believe that changed me. i believe it changed me for the better.robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales. robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out. tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular. i want more of that definitely he said. hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see. we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france. his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales try conceded a penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front the line-out remains fallible despite a superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.deutsche boerse set to woo lse bosses of deutsche boerse and the london stock exchange are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for the lse will be raised to £1.5bn ($2.9bn). last month the german exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for lse valuing it at £1.3bn. paris-based euronext owner of liffe in london has also said it is interested in bidding for lse. euronext is due to hold talks with lse this week and it is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid. euronext chief jean-francois theodore is scheduled to meet his lse counterpart clara furse on friday. deutsche boerse chief werner seifert is meeting ms furse on thursday in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in december. the lse rejected deutsche boerse s proposed £1.3bn offer in december saying it undervalued the business. but it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a significantly-improved proposal would be in the interests of lse s shareholders and customers. in the meantime euronext which combines the paris amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash but added that: there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made. a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. according to the ft in its latest meeting deutsche boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the london exchange. the newspaper said the german suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of london and let ms furse take the helm. other reports this week said the deutsche boerse might even consider selling its luxembourg-based clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. its ownership of clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger. lse shareholders feared a deutsche boerse takeover would force them to use clearstream making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.probe launched on ken nazi jibe an investigation by the standards board is under way following allegations that ken livingstone has brought his office into disrepute. the probe follows the london mayor s comments to a jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard after a party about a week ago. the local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others. it has the power to suspend or bar labour s mr livingstone from office. a complaint was made to the body by the board of deputies of british jews and the commission for racial equality. speaking after the investigation was announced bob neill leader of the london assembly conservatives said: he has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership. his administration is now in crisis. on sunday deputy mayor nicky gavron told the bbc s politics show she believed the mayor of london would say sorry on tuesday for offending the wider jewish community. the prime minister tony blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused. the mayor accused oliver finegold of the evening standard newspaper of doorstepping him at a predominately gay event held for mp chris smith. ms gavron said she thought mr livingstone s comments were inappropriate but she did not believe the mayor was anti-semitic. she said: i work very closely with ken so i can speak of what he s like in his guarded and unguarded moments and... he is in no way anti-jewish i wouldn t for a moment work with him if he were. on the other hand i think his remarks were inappropriate and i believe it is important and i believe he will come to the point where he says i regret that i have caused offence to the wider jewish community . i hope he will do it soon and it is mooted that he is going to make some sort of statement on tuesday.lib dems predict best ever poll the lib dems are set for their best results in both the general election and the local council polls one of their frontbenchers has predicted. local government spokesman ed davey was speaking as the party launched its campaign for the local elections being held in 37 english council areas. the flagship pledge is to replace council tax with a local income tax. the tories say the lib dems would make people pay more tax and labour says the party s sums do not add up. looking to the coming elections which are all expected to be held on 5 may mr davey said: we are going to be winning more votes and winning more seats. i think we are going to have the best general election results and local election results we have ever had under [party leader] charles kennedy. i couldn t think of a stronger endorsement of a leader.tory stalking horse meyer dies sir anthony meyer the tory backbencher who challenged margaret thatcher for the party leadership in 1989 has died. he was 84 had been suffering from cancer for many months and died at his london home. that failed stalking horse leadership challenge made it easier for michael heseltine to mount his own bid. that in turn paved the way for john major to move into 10 downing street after the second ballot. meyer s constituency party clwyd north west which he had represented as an mp for more than 20 years deselected him as a result of that challenge. sir anthony john charles meyer was born on 27 october 1920. educated at eton and at new college oxford he served in the scots guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in normandy. he worked under edward heath on europe at the foreign office and subsequently won the eton and slough seat for the tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. labour regained the seat two years later and meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter parliament. his prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.applegate s charity show closes us musical sweet charity has cancelled its run on broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows. star christina applegate had to pull out of pre-broadway performances earlier this month with a broken foot. producer barry weissler said he was deeply proud of the show but said the decision to close it was painful but fiscally responsible . applegate who starred in tv comedy married with children had been hoping to make her broadway debut in the show. the 33-year-old injured herself while performing in chicago and had been hoping to recover in time for its official new york opening on 21 april. she had received mixed reviews for performances in minneapolis and chicago. previews of the $7.5m (£4m) show were due to begin on 4 april. sweet charity tells the story of charity hope valentine a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man. it was first performed on broadway in 1966 with gwen verdon in the title role while shirley maclaine starred in the 1969 film version.double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday s game with italy because of injury. parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre. jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. meanwhile mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first-choice kicker in rome. the centre was wales hero in the 11-9 six nations win over england landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. first-choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson s greater kicking range but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal. our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but giving him the kicks is something we ll talk about in selection this week wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales. henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday s game. i thrive on it and think it makes me perform better he said. i m glad it s a short week before the italy game. there was so much build-up before england but we fly out to rome on thursday and we ll be back playing again.ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side s task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko. milan s talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday s champions league first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. it s a loss (to milan) but it could be worse if they didn t have such quality to bring in ferguson said. how much they miss him i think they ll know tomorrow night. ferguson said milan s front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. they can play rui costa and play kaka forward. they can bring serginho in and they can play (jon dahl) tomasson he said. ferguson s own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman who has not played for three months. ruud is the best striker in europe. what i have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long he said. his ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision. ferguson though is confident his young players particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo are up to the task. we have an opportunity to win this cup this year no question about that he declared. with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane paul scholes and ryan giggs we must have a fantastic chance. it is a view shared by rooney who believes if we can get past milan we have a great chance . as soon as i knew we were playing milan i got excited. looking at the draw it is anyone s trophy but we have every chance. hopefully we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester. milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. milan beat juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at old trafford and ancelotti said: we are all very happy to return (to old trafford) to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation. ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory. it s fundamental that we don t allow them to take control of the game. our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game he said. they have great quality in attack they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.rock star sued by ex-girlfriend motley crue guitarist mick mars is being sued by his ex-girlfriend for $10 million (£5.4 million) claiming he broke a promise to take care of her. the woman robin mantooth said mars promised her repeatedly that he would provide financial support in the event of the couple breaking up. when they split in december mantooth says mars denied any such agreement. she is asking a los angeles court to award her half the musician s property a monthly allowance and damages. mantooth added that the pair became lovers in 1990 after which she abandoned her career as a documentary film-maker to move in with the guitarist at his malibu home. she is also claiming that mars 53 has failed to provide her with any material support since they ceased to be a couple. motley crue recently reunited after being apart for a period of five years. they originally formed in the early 1980s and scored six hits in the uk including girls girls girls in 1987. they are embarking on a world tour later this year which will take in 60 cities across the us europe asia and australia. mars - real name bob allen deal - underwent hip replacement surgery in october. he suffers from a degenerative rheumatic disease which causes ligaments and tendons to attach to the bone.moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back. jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc: full-backs are too far away from the action. that s not a reflection on robinson personally. he added: i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is after all where games usually start and finish. moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year s tournament. assertiveness in the pack isn t there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained. wer e not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that. with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience moore added. you can t do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them. we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.new yob targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday. ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years. police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved. prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly. he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. we have not defeated this problem by any means but shown together what can be done he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance. ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that about a third of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.kilroy-silk quits shameful ukip ex-chat show host robert kilroy-silk has quit the uk independence party and accused it of betraying its supporters. the mep said he was ashamed to have joined the party which he labelled as a joke . he plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called veritas - latin for truth. ukip leader roger knapman said he would break open the champagne adding: it was nice knowing him now goodbye . however he did say the ex-chat show host had been quite useful initially . he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the (european) election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye mr knapman told bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroy-silk posed a threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party. mr kilroy-silk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at a meeting in hinckley leicestershire. his decision came as ukip officials began a process which could have triggered mr kilroy-silk s expulsion. it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months. it began with a flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last june s european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership. mr kilroy-silk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat sitting on their backsides in brussels. he told bbc news 24: i tried to change the party i nagged all the way through the summer to do things to get moving because i thought it was criminal what they were doing it was a betrayal. mr kilroy-silk also told sky news there was masses of support for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen. ukip won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech mr kilroy-silk says the result offered ukip an amazing opportunity but the party s leadership had done nothing and gone awol . there were no policies no energy no vision and no spokespeople he said. the party is going nowhere and i m embarrassed with its allies in europe and i m ashamed to be a member of the party said mr kilroy-silk. he said his conviction in britain s right to govern itself had not changed. he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency. reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to ukip s disciplinary committee for bringing the party into disrepute . on thursday the party challenged mr kilroy-silk to stand down as an mep so voters can get a genuine ukip candidate.beattie return calms attack fears everton striker james beattie has been declared fit for training on tuesday despite suffering an alleged assault last saturday. beattie 27 is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being the victim of an unprovoked assault in birmingham. he was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following everton s 3-1 win over aston villa. he was shaken but not badly injured said everton spokesman ian ross. he added: he did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges. he has spoken to manager david moyes about what happened. beattie was suspended for the win at aston villa after his red card against chelsea and he will be available again for the merseyside derby at liverpool on 20 march.drink remark acts as diversion the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed. jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnell s comment was ill-advised . the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems mr law said. scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark. mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. the one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk . mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said: i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it. however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage . mr macdonell said: i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured. mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking. he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. mr law added: i think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland. we don t want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness. he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him . he added: here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark. the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ill-judged comment and withdraw it immediately. in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. he told ms sturgeon: it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk . that is completely untrue. perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.jarvis sells tube stake to spain shares in engineering group jarvis have soared more than 16% on news that it is offloading its stake in london underground consortium tube lines. the sale of the 33% stake to spain s ferrovial for £146m ($281m) is a lifeline to jarvis which was weighed down by debts of more than £230m. the company recently warned it could go under if it did not secure a refinancing deal by mid-january 2005. but now its banks have agreed to extend its credit facilities until march 2006. the company also said it had agreed terms over the completion of 14 of its biggest construction projects under the government s private finance initiative (pfi). jarvis wants to scale back the division which has proved too costly and has been blamed for many of its problems. instead it plans to focus on uk rail renewal roads and plant hire work. madrid-based ferrovial already holds a 33% stake in tube lines which maintains the jubilee northern and piccadilly lines. the spanish group has been keen to snap up more uk infrastructure assets having bought amey in 2003. jarvis said the sale which raked in more than the £100m analysts had expected would substantially enhance its financial position. i am now confident that we can now move forward in 2005 towards rebuilding jarvis and return it to growth as a profitable business said chief executive alan lovell. shares in jarvis were up more than 16% to 18 pence by the close of trade on friday.q&a: malcolm glazer and man utd the battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer. no formal offer has been made yet but manchester united have confirmed they have received a detailed proposal from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. reports have put the offer at 300p per share which would value manchester united at about £800m ($1.5bn). the approach by the 76-year-old owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons avi and joel. a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down. however the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand. mr glazer s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed not... in the best interests of the company by manchester united s board when they rejected his approach last year. however mr glazer s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m. while united s board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazer s latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal. supporters group shareholders united - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazer s campaign - said it would fight any move. manchester united are a debt-free company. we don t want to fall into debt and we don t need to fall into debt shareholders united s sean bones told the bbc. united s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live. no-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table. the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united s largest shareholders the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus. through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. mr glazer owns 28.1%. joe mclean a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was utterly crucial . mr glazer s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. if that s the case the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence maybe 305. if that s the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does this bid could well go ahead. indeed it is. malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003. in february 2004 he said he was considering whether to bid for the club. no bid emerged but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. in october 2004 manchester united said they had received a preliminary approach which turned out to have come from mr glazer. however the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. at the club s annual general meeting in november mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. legal adviser maurice watkins commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive david gill. but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team.kennedy predicts bigger turnout voters pent up passion could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election charles kennedy has said. the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign. his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts. ex-foreign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of pager politics and not being heard. he like mr kennedy pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war. mr cook who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were more interested in politics than ever before . they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain. there s a message there for politicians. he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to speak more from the heart . we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for. he also criticised the cult of personality politics: there s far too much interest in celebrities. politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry. the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting.worldcom boss left books alone former worldcom boss bernie ebbers who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud never made accounting decisions a witness has told jurors. david myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that mr ebbers was not responsible for worldcom s problems. the phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm s shares. mr myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors. on monday defence lawyer reid weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. during cross examination he asked mr myers if he ever knew mr ebbers make an accounting decision . not that i am aware of mr myers replied. did you ever know mr ebbers to make an accounting entry into worldcom books mr weingarten pressed. no replied the witness. mr myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former worldcom chief financial officer scott sullivan. defence lawyers have been trying to paint mr sullivan who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial as the mastermind behind worldcom s accounting house of cards. mr ebbers team meanwhile are looking to portray him as an affable boss who by his own admission is more pe graduate than economist. whatever his abilities mr ebbers transformed worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. worldcom s problems mounted however as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. when the firm finally collapsed shareholders lost about $180bn and 20 000 workers lost their jobs. mr ebbers trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former ceo faces a substantial jail sentence. he has firmly declared his innocence.britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals. kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope paula radcliffe dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 000m. britain s men s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games. the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games. it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and just like holmes finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003. but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis who was troubled by injury has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze. and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey who came fourth in athens. the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. kenteris the 200m champion in 2000 and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games adrian annus (hammer) robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. the fallout from the thg scandal which rocked the sport in 2003 continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg. american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m. and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.iaaf to rule on greek sprint pair greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer. the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) council held a conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision. kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years. the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date. however the iaaf will determine the sprinters future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. the sport s ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport. the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf which have been taken into account. the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete where they had said they would be. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago when they decided to fly back to greece early. just before the olympics the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games. kenteris 31 won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000 where thanou 29 won silver in the 100m.man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals. rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet. rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes free-kick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker. - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson: it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in. i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again he s truly a fabulous player. everton: martyn hibbert yobo stubbs naysmith osman carsley arteta kilbane mcfadden bent. subs: wright pistone weir plessis vaughan. manchester united: carroll gary neville brown ferdinand heinze ronaldo phil neville keane scholes fortune rooney. subs: howard giggs smith miller spector. referee: r styles (hampshire)rock band u2 break ticket record u2 have smashed irish box office records with ticket sales for their dublin concerts after more than 150 000 were sold within 50 minutes. tickets for the two concerts at the city s croke park stadium were released at 8am on friday morning. nothing like it has ever been seen in ireland before said justin green spokesman for organisers mcd promoters. we could have sold a million tickets. the dublin dates on june 24 and 25 form part of the worldwide vertigo tour. the tour begins in san diego on 28 march and will cover 13 us cities. the band will also play 24 european gigs finishing in lisbon in august. mr green said that ticket outlets had been bombarded by u2 fans. unfortunately there s thousands and thousands of disappointed fans all over the country which is disappointing but there s only two dates confirmed he said. many fans camped on the streets of the irish capital for three days to ensure they were first in line at ticketmaster in st stephen s green shopping centre where the tickets went on sale on friday. however the majority of tickets priced at between 59.50 and 80 euro each were sold online. earlier this week bono announced that the band would play two shows at the venue which holds almost 80 000 people due to the phenomenal demand for tickets.umaga ready for lions all blacks captain tama umaga has warned the british and irish lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour. but umaga in england for saturday s irb rugby aid match also backed new zealand to win the three-test series against the lions. he told bbc sport: it s potentially the most fearsome line-up i ve ever come up against. they re awesome. but i d back us all the way to beat them when they come over. lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the june-july tour next month. when woodward was appointed last year it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players. but umaga said: he d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations. don t get me wrong england have got a lot of talented guys and i m sure there are some of them who ll make the lions test xv. but you can t disguise wales and ireland in particular. some of the tries they ve scored have been great. i ll admit it ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian o driscoll. umaga will meet o driscoll in saturday s rugby aid match at twickenham with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side. o driscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad coached by woodward that are tipped for lions call-ups. it ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys although a lot can change between now and june umaga said. the 31-year-old admitted interest in the lions tour was immense calling it the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings . he added: as players it s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions. in fact it s not just us all blacks - it s the talk of the country. umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturday s charity game which features a host of big names including george gregan andrew mehrtens and chris latham. but he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. the second [southern hemisphere coach] rod macqueen made the approach i didn t hesitate. it was great when new zealand rugby then gave me the all clear. thankfully i didn t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn t miss all the horrific reports on the news. there are so many people that were affected are still affected and will be affected for a long time. it s just good to know we can do something minor to help out. - the match will be televised on bbc one at 1400 gmt on saturday.ocean s twelve raids box office ocean s twelve the crime caper sequel starring george clooney brad pitt and julia roberts has gone straight to number one in the us box office chart. it took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales according to studio estimates. the sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across europe. it knocked last week s number one national treasure into third place. wesley snipes blade: trinity was in second taking $16.1m (£8.4m). rounding out the top five was animated fable the polar express starring tom hanks and festive comedy christmas with the kranks. ocean s twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a december release in the us after the three films in the lord of the rings trilogy. the sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor ocean s eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. a remake of the 1960s film starring frank sinatra and the rat pack ocean s eleven was directed by oscar-winning director steven soderbergh. soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites clooney pitt and roberts with matt damon andy garcia and elliott gould. catherine zeta-jones joins the all-star cast. it s just a fun good holiday movie said dan fellman president of distribution at warner bros. however us critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project with the los angeles times labelling it a dispiriting vanity project . a milder review in the new york times dubbed the sequel unabashedly trivial .brown proud of economy record gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election. the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail. analysing mr brown s position before the speech bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw sharp dividing lines with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest £60bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by £35bn. mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade our correspondent said. on friday night mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether as the conservatives claim he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997. following the chancellor s keynote speech the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed alan milburn labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has the same passion and the same commitments for the job as when labour came to power in 1997 he said. and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said: i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know and tony has not made up his mind. on friday the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy crime education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were worthless .elton plays paris charity concert sir elton john has performed at a special concert in paris to raise money for the victims of the asian tsunami. the british singer played to a 2 700-strong audience on sunday at the french capital s bastille opera house. the concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. money raised will go to the fondation pour l enfance (foundation for childhood) which aims to rebuild a children s shelter in sri lanka. sir elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former french president valery giscard d estaing and his wife anne-aymone. the veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval. he told the crowd: throughout the years i ve done a lot of drugs and alcohol. it s true that i was a nightmare impossible. for the last 14 years i ve been normal. now my drug is called david - a reference to david furnish his partner. the crowd who greeted each song with a standing ovation also included french singer charles aznavour and british ambassador sir john holmes. sir elton has also teamed up with phil collins to record a version of eric clapton s 1991 hit tears in heaven to raise money for the relief fund. a release date has yet to be set for the recording which was organised by sharon osbourne.blair to face mps amid feud talk tony blair faces his first prime minister s questions of 2005 after a week of renewed speculation about his relationship with gordon brown. meanwhile the chancellor is leaving britain on a high-profile tour of africa to highlight poverty issues. but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book. labour mps have warned against disunity and tory leader michael howard may well take up the theme in the commons. the tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like schoolboys squabbling in a playground . michael howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes head-to-head with the prime minister in the commons. at a campaign poster launch on tuesday mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. later this week the prime minister is due to set out the themes of his party s next election manifesto which for the past two polls have been drawn up by the chancellor. mr brown meanwhile is visiting tanzania mozambique and kenya to highlight the plight of many africans hit by aids war and famine - issues which mr blair has also spoken out on. the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book. mr blair told mps and peers: i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a scorching from mps. on tuesday deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news: they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line. the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. mr blair then changed his mind in june 2004 after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston. in mr peston s book mr brown is alleged to have told the prime minister: there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe.robots march to us cinema summit animated movie robots has opened at the top of the us and canada box office chart taking $36.5m (£19m) on its first weekend on release. featuring the voices of ewan mcgregor halle berry robin williams and mel brooks robots follows a robot inventor who moves to a big city. vin diesel s family comedy the pacifier fell to the number two spot taking $18.1m (£9.4m). new bruce willis movie hostage opened at number four with $9.8m (£5.1m). however a recut version of mel gibson s the passion of the christ which featured less violence than last year s original movie took just $239 850 (£125 000) despite opening in 957 cinemas. the new version of the film received little publicity and the original version is available across the us on dvd. we certainly had higher expectations than what we got said rob schwartz head of distribution for newmarket films which released the passion of the christ. we were trying to get the film out there hoping it would reach an audience that it didn t quite reach the first time around. it doesn t seem to have worked out quite as well as we had hoped. meanwhile will smith comedy hitch has become the top film at the global box office after taking an estimated $30.1m (£15.6m) over the weekend at cinemas outside north america according to industry website screen daily. it has taken $65.5m (£34.1m) so far buoyed by opening at number one in the uk last weekend and a successful run in germany. the movie which cost a reported $70m (£36.4m) to make has taken $138m (£72m) in the us so far.bees handed potential man utd tie brentford face a home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton. the league one side held the saints at st mary s in their fifth-round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against sir alex ferguson s side. newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest. bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay. the ties will be played on the weekend of 12-13 march. was delighted to be paired with united although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie. we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you can t deny it s exciting he said. it would be a sell-out. it will probably be on television. we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation. we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat a premiership team. we ve got to beat southampton first and that s going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration. welcomed the opportunity to face united. we re not counting on anything yet he said. it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive. but i ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham. there are no easy ties in the fa cup and i m sure nobody is counting on one. newcastle v tottenham or nottingham forest southampton or brentford v manchester united bolton v arsenal or sheffield united burnley or blackburn v leicestercurbishley delight for johansson charlton manager alan curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker jonatan johansson after beating norwich. curbishley said after the 4-0 win: there was talk about norwich being interested in the summer but i have a lot of faith in jonatan. when there was talk of other clubs i just told him he was going nowhere. he s part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on. i m sure he s happy here but i was delighted with all the players. curbishley was subjected to criticism from charlton fans recently and he said: the thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction. that s happened for however long i ve been here and we don t want people taking sides.us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema-goers and the tv-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics. bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity love-in . this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic . as chris rock accurately said they re about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said. the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way. recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner. unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. but entertainment weekly s dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated. the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said. a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt. on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win. screen international s us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004 s films have simply not grabbed the public s imagination. film-makers haven t produced films that people adore this year he said. they adored saving private ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. 2004 s films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all. audiences don t necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty. as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful. mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added: i m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the oscars. mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rock s humour could prompt america s conservative states to switch off. so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood s million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said. eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss. oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads. and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese s aviator and million dollar baby. mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said. after all it s still one of the biggest tv events of the year.be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson. if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas. in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one-click online purchase. it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned. the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent. this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately. i have never to my shame managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe s computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a fundamental lack of trust of tony blair as prime minister. he said backing his party was not a wasted vote adding that with the lib dems what you see is what you get . he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme. questions from callers a studio audience and the show s presenter covered lib dem tax plans anti-terror laws and immigration. mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics. 1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair michael howard and myself were all class of 83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition he said. we don t actually hear the argument any longer: lib dems good people reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it s a wasted vote . you don t hear that because the evidence of people s senses demonstrates that it isn t a wasted vote. but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people. there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government he said. what we ve got to do as a party - what i ve got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get. mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party s plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100 000 saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session.robben sidelined with broken foot chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks. robben had an mri scan on the injury sustained during the premiership win at blackburn on monday. six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then i need a few more weeks to be completely fit again he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad. i had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis. the 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with roma s olivier dacourt. and he added: it felt different then last summer when i had the same injury on my other foot. then i could walk already after three days but i stayed sidelined for a long period. i hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks. chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march. the fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month banks told the club s website. one is a chip on the side of his foot the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months. david beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 world cup in korea and japan. robben who has been a key part of the blues push for four trophies claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by blackburn midfielder aaron mokoena. i felt my leg go he said. i felt it straight away after mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.tories attack burglar u-turns tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars. the government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying: it is not householders who should be frightened it s the burglars. home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law. metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps: if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law. instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday mr howard told bbc radio 4 s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said: we ve had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns. it s not surprising gordon brown told him: there s nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe. mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke. he said: the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making. the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said. tory mp patrick mercer s private member s bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids. an estimated 25 000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800 000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment. the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter during which time the mass killings took place and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but in many cases orphans too. as the women die the number of rwanda s orphans rises. until recently very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt founder of the survivors fund (surf) one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled said it was a recognition before it was too late that the survivors should be a priority for help.$1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay $1m (£522 000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves. judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004 shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton s contract. she was leaving by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it. the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman sir phil watts and production chief walter van der vijver. an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company s behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had fooled the market about its reserves the investigation said she did nothing to inquire further. in all shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.arthur hailey: king of the bestsellers novelist arthur hailey who has died at the age of 84 was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries from the hotels to high finance. born in luton bedfordshire on 5 april 1920 hailey was the only child of working class parents they could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. he served as a pilot with the royal air force during world war ii flying fighter planes to the middle east. it was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut the television screenplay flight into danger. hailey emigrated to canada in 1947 where he eventually became a citizen. he wanted to be a writer from an early age but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to toronto. i fell to daydreaming. i visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. could i fly the airplane i was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn t flown for nine years... hailey later recalled. the canadian broadcasting corporation bought flight into danger for $600 (£318) and it was shown on tv in april 1956. it was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy airplane! starring leslie nielsen. hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years before turning to novels. he went on to produce 11 best-selling books which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. flight into danger was adapted to become hailey s first novel runaway zero-eight in 1958. the final diagnosis and in high places followed both achieving a popular following. but it was not until hotel in 1965 that hollywood came calling. the hit novel took four years to write and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. it was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s starring james brolin. airport (1968) arguably remains hailey s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. the thriller follows events in the sky and on the ground at a snow-logged airport when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb. the book was adapted into a hit film in 1970 starring burt lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and dean martin as a womanising pilot alongside jean seberg and jacqueline bisset. in a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. the writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred drawing his characters from real life and taking up to three years to produce each book. i have never been able to write quickly or easily. i am too self-critical for that. i am never satisfied he once said. in 1969 he moved to nassau in the bahamas with his wife sheila. wheels (1971) the moneychangers (1975) and overload (1979) followed. despite a lukewarm response from critics and few literary accolades hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of hollywood producers. strong medicine hailey s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry was turned into a film in 1986 starring sam neill douglas fairbanks jr and a panoply of former soap stars. the 1997 novel detective proved to be hailey s final book when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. hailey s health began to deteriorate in recent years twice undergoing heart surgery. he suffered a stroke just two months ago. he died in his sleep on wednesday after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in new providence island. he had a wonderful life. his greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that said his wife sheila.mccririck out of big brother show racing pundit john mccririck has become the latest contestant to be evicted from celebrity big brother. he was nominated to leave the channel 4 show by fellow housemates alongside happy mondays dancer bez. at one time bez was among the most popular contestants but he has since become withdrawn and argumentative. mccririck was ordered to leave the house on monday following jackie stallone the actor sylvester s mother who was first to be evicted. bez reacted badly to the news that he had been nominated by five of his fellow housemates whilst john received four votes against him. sylvester stallone s ex-wife brigitte nielsen nominated both john and bez. she said: bez is a difficult human being. there s something wrong with him. even though he s making an effort he s not very happy in here. former holby city actor jeremy edwards said he had nominated bez after he became agitated on friday night and talked about escaping over the wall to go clubbing. he said bez was being loopy and stressed . according to bookmaker ladbrokes john mccririck was 1/3 favourite to be evicted on monday while bez was at 9/4 . mccririck faced the public vote on friday and received 67% of the vote to keep him in the house whilst jackie stallone was evicted.williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield. that would leave the scots as favourites to win the wooden spoon for the second year running. i have never quit anything in my life apart from maybe painting the kitchen he told bbc sport. the support we have been given from murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100%. williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership. but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts recently sacked as scotland football manager after a poor run of results. how can a german football coach and an australian rugby coach have anything in common he asked. it is a bizarre analogy. it is so absurd that it borders on the humorous. williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory. that is not beyond the realms of possibility he admitted. there s nothing much between the teams so we could win the next three games or lose them. but i actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach. it helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach. we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too.dent continues adelaide progress american taylor dent reached the final of the australian hardcourt event in adelaide with a crushing 6-1 6-1 win over argentine juan ignacio chela. dent will meet swede joachim johansson on sunday after the second seed survived a tense tie-break to defeat belgium s olivier rochus 6-1 7-6 (7/5). johansson the boyfriend of lleyton hewitt s sister jaslyn received strong crowd support on saturday. it feels like home for me because jaslyn lives here said johansson. rochus was leading 5-4 in the second set tiebreak but his concentration was ruffled by a disputed line call and the match slipped away. it was so close - one mistake like this and the match is over it s tough. for me it was clearly out rochus said.houllier praises benitez regime former liverpool manager gerard houllier has praised the work of his anfield successor rafael benitez. houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of benitez since the spaniard took over at liverpool. but houllier told bbc sport: in private and in public i have stressed i believe rafa is doing a good job. he is the right man at the right place. rafa is a good coach and a good man. i ve spoken to him since he has been at liverpool and never criticised him. houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving liverpool in may following six years at anfield. the former france boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed mark hughes as wales national coach. he has been working for uefa covering the premiership for french television and also coaching in brazil with national coach carlos alberto perreira. houllier said: if a good club comes up at the right time then yes i am ready to come back. it has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and i have learned things. i have been involved in football since leaving liverpool and my batteries are recharged. houllier has been impressed with the quality in the premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with jose mourinho s work at leaders chelsea. he said: chelsea are doing very well. they have some very good creative players in damien duff and arjen robben and didier drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against newcastle. they have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. they have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with jose s principles. jose had results before he came to chelsea and i think he will have an impact in the premiership because he manages his team very cleverly. and houllier away from his brief at liverpool has been hugely impressed with the premiership. he said: it is a very exciting league. it is entertaining goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. it has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the premiership than other leagues. it is a very good product.saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors the world s largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden. the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine. gm s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory s closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group s new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group s opel workers in ruesselsheim germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm s cuts. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saab s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw mercedes and jaguar. the segment s leaders do not agree. gm s plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130 000 cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. beyond the 12 000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab s losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was stupid he said. in a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of 35 000 test cars across 40 countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.tsunami to cost sri lanka $1.3bn sri lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30 000 of its people its central bank says. this estimate is preliminary bank governor sunil mendis told reporters and could rise in 2006. the island state is asking for about $320m from the international monetary fund to help pay for relief he said. the bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. according to mr mendis half the imf support could come from a freeze on debt repayments which would free up resources immediately. the rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. sri lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors. the paris club of 19 creditors meets on 12 january to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami which ravaged south and east asia on 26 december. some 150 000 people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. a full reckoning of the economic cost to sri lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. but already it looks likely that growth in the first half of 2005 will slow mr mendis told reporters although he would not say by how much. one side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. the currency has strengthened 4% since late december coming close to 100 rupees to the us dollar for the first time in more than six months.apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple s asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters. apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites. the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers net providers. in making his ruling judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. california has so-called shield laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. the judge wrote: ...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of hits on a website about apple have and will happen. but an interested public is not the same as the public interest . judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists too. the electronic frontier foundation which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider said the ruling had potentially wide implications. anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products the lib dems say. vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see proper health checks when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection. were economic conditions to deteriorate at all large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit mr cable told bbc news. banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead. mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the extreme problems such as loan sharking but ministers had been a bit complacent about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was extremely expensive and there were lots of exclusions . mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on 5 may. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door . if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government. that s going to be the story i think of this coming general election.robinson answers critics england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline. england were beaten 11-9 by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday. robinson said: we are certainly not on the decline. you lose one game and it doesn t make you a bad team. i have no doubt in the players we ve got. we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day. england find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987. but full-back robinson believes the new-look england team can stop the rot against france. last weekend we should have won the game he said. but if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then i am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need. we proved that in the autumn - when we put in some excellent performances - and we just need to build on that. it was a disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that. but we are certainly not out. we will come out fighting this week. robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old newcastle centre mathew tait who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france. i have had a word with mathew said robinson. i still believe in him. he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly (barkley) because of the kicking. mathew has just got to take it on the chin keep working hard like he is doing and i m sure he will feature in some of the games.lawyer attacks anti-terror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government s anti-terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name. ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. he was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign. mr macdonald told bbc news: the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community. i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally . under the anti-terrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. as far as i m concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this. he added. the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday. according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare. they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission (siac) - a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects. mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow. but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio 4 s today programme that more lawyers may go. i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said. they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights. helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said. without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play-off in three weeks time. but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french. no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march - sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham. but how the mighty have fallen. england sat on rugby s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners. but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney. and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play-off against italy in a fortnight. england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987. coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars. and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations. and they won only two games against scotland and italy in 2004. wales most recent championship title was in 1994 and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al. but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly-men tag that has dogged them for the past few years. the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years to france and england. but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland (twice) and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials. and so to france. brilliant one minute inept the next. but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings. welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam. but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march.few ready for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act due to come into force next month because of government failures say mps. from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors surgeries. but an all-party committee said it was not confident many would be ready. it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a lack of consistent leadership . the act comes into effect in england wales and northern ireland on 1 january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies subject to various exemptions. but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an unusually high turnover of staff within the department which had seriously interfered with its work said the constitutional affairs select committee. it said despite four years of preparations some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. the dca had failed to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a lack of consistent leadership the mps found. committee chairman alan beith said: the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime has been lacking. a spokesman for the dca said: the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong clear leadership. it has delivered a simple liberal fees regime guidance on the act which has been widely praised and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.fed warns of more us rate rises the us looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005 according to the federal reserve. minutes of the december meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the fed are worried about accelerating inflation. the clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 gmt on wednesday but depressed us shares. the markets are starting to fear a more aggressive fed in 2005 said richard yamarone of argus research. the dow jones index dropped almost 100 points on tuesday with the nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. the dollar also gained ground against sterling on tuesday reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on wednesday morning. the release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 december meeting was much faster than usual indicating the fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. this too is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. the key fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. that long trough might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets said the federal open markets committee (fomc) which sets interest rates. the odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early february economists said. but the respite for the dollar which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive us trade and budget deficits may be short-lived. you can t rule out a further correction... but we don t think it s a change in direction in the dollar said jason daw at merrill lynch. nothing fundamental has changed.donor attacks blair-brown feud the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds. duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its poor response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs. the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives. robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said: disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition. the businessman whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq. and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as piecemeal and poor . the people there need practical help not just pledges of money he said. the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more. british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt. in a separate development robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not perceived as a problem by the voters adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the abstentions party was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an unremittingly new labour election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis the leader of britain s biggest union unison told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.parmalat to return to stockmarket parmalat the italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal hopes to be back on the italian stock exchange in july. the firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; £9.6bn). this was eight times higher than it had previously stated. in a statement issued on wednesday night parmalat finanziaria detailed administrators latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group. as part of the re-listing on the italian stock exchange creditors debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. the company s creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. the plan is likely to give creditors of parmalat finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. this is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. creditors of parmalat the main operating company are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%. several former top parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. lawmakers said on wednesday night enrico bondi the turnaround specialist appointed by the italian government as parmalat s chief executive spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the chamber of deputies industry commission. bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the parmalat group s quotation on the market in july italian news agency apcom quoted several lawmakers as

from brian o driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy. a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer s try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickie s try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes. it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs. when they finally did just before the half-hour mark o driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead. the only ireland player offering a real threat was o driscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over with o gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul. an o gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o driscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon d arcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout. de marigny; mi bergamasco canale masi

director parker british film director sir alan parker has been made an officer in the order of arts and letters one of france s highest cultural honours. sir alan received his decoration in paris on wednesday from french culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres. you have explored the possibilities of film with an immense talent mr de vabres said as he presented the award. parker praised french films saying: hollywood which created modern cinema uses it only as a commodity. he told the minister: i am honoured to be thus distinguished by france the flag carrier of cinema throughout the world. sir alan s films include oscar-winning fame plus midnight express and the commitments. a founding member of the director s guild of great britain he is a former chairman of the uk film council and on the board of the british film institute. through your work and your campaigns you have shown us how the artist occupies an essential place in our contemporary society mr de vabres said. through your dreams which you show us through the links that you weave you question the world through the mirror of your work. he also cited the director s 2003 film the life of david gale in which kevin spacey played a man on death row as proof of his veritable artistic commitment against the death sentence .parents face video game lessons ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry. the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in 2003 britons spent £1 152m on games more than ever before. and this christmas parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother giselle said her son s killer warren leblanc 17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating stefan s murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification. adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can t and they deserve to be protected said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn t play. roger bennett director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association said: a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. they will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding recognition and awareness of the games rating system ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content. among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves. according to industry statistics a majority of players are over 18 with the average age of a gamer being 29. academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as manhunt with violent responses in players. in a report published this week for the video standards council dr guy cumberbatch said: the research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny. dr cumberbatch head of the social policy think tank the communications research group reviewed the studies on the issue. he concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.moyes u-turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas. the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0 saying gallas overreacted. but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. he said: i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct. moyes added: my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick re-run of the incident. the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturday s match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised. moyes continued: although the incident was totally out of character - james has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. james did issue a formal apology to myself his team-mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily. speaking immediately after the game moyes said: i don t think it was a sending-off i have been a centre-half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that. not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. what has happened to big strong centre-halves i thought it was a push initially and i still don t think it was a sending-off. an angry beattie initially said: he (gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him. i can tell you it wasn t an intentional headbutt. we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if you re going to stay in my way i ll go straight over you . our heads barely touched and it wasn t an intentional headbutt.hendrix guitar fetches £100 000 a much-loved guitar belonging to jimi hendrix has been sold for £100 000 at an auction in london. the 1965 fender stratocaster was one of a number of guitars included in the sale dedicated to the rock legend. the vast archive of instruments signed records and posters were collected by a dedicated fan who had become friendly with the star. the auction was billed as the biggest collection of hendrix memorabilia to go under the hammer. the majority of the items were collected by fan bob terry who began collecting at the age of 17. he later sold it on to another collector. hendrix widely considered one of the best guitarists of his era died of a drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. the 1965 fender stratocaster was used by the musician on tour and in his studio. a poem written by hendrix two weeks after his infamous appearance at the monterey festival where he set light to his guitar went for £10 000. the jimi hendrix experience s first single hey joe signed by all the band was sold for £2 000. the sale hosted by auctioneers cooper owen was held at the hard rock cafe in london.housewives lift channel 4 ratings the debut of us television hit desperate housewives has helped lift channel 4 s january audience share by 12% compared to last year. other successes such as celebrity big brother and the simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass bbc2 for the first month since last july. however the channel s share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with january 2004. celebrity big brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series. comedy drama desperate housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date attracting a quarter of the television audience. the two main television channels bbc1 and itv1 have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for january while five s proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. digital multi-channel tv is continuing to be the strongest area of growth with the bbc reporting freeview box ownership of five million including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. its share of the audience soared by 20% in january 2005 compared with last year and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards. the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday. tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo his transport and environment spokesman said the plans stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added: when the police say that you have to take them seriously . he acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision. i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken. he also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening. sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and deeply flawed . he said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained. tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldn t he. and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll. and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election. the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from. mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time. the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.mcdonald s boss bell dies aged 44 charlie bell the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant mcdonald s has died of cancer aged 44. mr bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in may last year a month after taking over the top job. he resigned in november to fight the illness. joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker mr bell quickly moved through its ranks becoming australia s youngest store manager at 19. a popular go-getter he is credited with helping revive mcdonald s sales. mr bell leaves a wife and daughter. as we mourn his passing i ask you to keep charlie s family in your hearts and prayers chief executive james skinner said in a statement. and remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth charlie lived life to the fullest. no matter what cards life dealt charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for mcdonald s. after running the company s australian business in the 1990s mr bell moved to the us in 1999 to run operations in asia africa and the middle east. in 2001 he took over the reins in europe mcdonald s second most important market. he became chief operating officer and president in 2002. mr bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as ceo jim cantalupo died suddenly of a heart attack in april. having worked closely with mr cantalupo who came out of retirement to turn mcdonald s around mr bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. he had promised not to let the company get fat dumb and happy and according to reuters once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. mr bell oversaw mcdonald s i m lovin it advertising campaign and introduced successes such as mccafe now the biggest coffee shop brand in australia and new zealand. colleagues said that mr bell was proud of his humble beginnings helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants.shares rise on new man utd offer shares in manchester united closed up 4.75% on monday following a new offer from us tycoon malcolm glazer. the board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal which values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. the club has previously rejected mr glazer s approaches out of hand. but a senior source at the club told the bbc: this time it s different. supporters group shareholders united however urged the club to reject the new deal. a spokesman for the shareholders united said: i can t see any difference (compared to mr glazer s previous proposals) other than £200m less debt. he isn t bringing any money into the club; he ll use our money to buy it. mr glazer s latest move is being led by mr glazer s two sons avi and joel according to the financial times. a proposal was received by david gill united s chief executive at the end of last week pitched at about 300p a share. david cummings head of uk equities for standard life investments said he believed a well funded 300p a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club. i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it he told the bbc. they can complain about it but it is curtains for them. they may not want him but they are going to get him. the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed. mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal though it is not clear by how much. for his proposal to succeed he needs the support of united s largest shareholders the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier. they own 29% of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle. mr glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid. nm rothschild the investment bank is advising mr glazer according to the financial times. his previous adviser jpmorgan quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board against its advice. but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazer s latest financial proposal.uk heading wrong way says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded: britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said. we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever. he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice. worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said: it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april not 1 january. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15% interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country.slow start to speedy net services faster broadband in the uk is becoming a reality as more internet providers offer super-fast services. some lucky britons can already take advantage of uk online s 8 megabits per second service which was launched in november 2004. bt retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service with a national rollout by year end. other service providers are expected to follow suit and a glut of new voice and video services will follow. if the bandwidth is there then isps will buy it said jill finger a research director at analyst firm idc. others will be watching bt retail s trials which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers with interest. for bt retail she said the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players. it has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back said ms finger. wanadoo is set to trial an 8mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services - which means it takes over the network from bt - which will provide speeds of up to 15mbps. there is no timetable for this at the moment. cable firms ntl and telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and according to an ntl spokesman are in a better position than bt in the long term. bt s network is limited compared to that of cable. with all the other services coming on stream such as video on demand the question is will 8mbps be enough he asked.uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net according to research. new episodes of 24 desperate housewives and six feet under appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us said a report. web tracking company envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. about 70% were using file-sharing program bittorrent the firm said. it s now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100 000 people globally said the report and an estimated 20 000 of those were from within the uk. fans of many popular us tv programmes like 24 usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases said the report people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country. missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet explained mr coppin. two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect the internet is now a global video recorder. exact figures are difficult to pin down but it is thought that about 80 000 to 100 000 people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term time-shifting to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky+ have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer. within half an hour recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then full-length films they can be processed - digitised - quickly. more people with high-speed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly. according to jupiter research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player (imp) last year which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.gangsters dominate gaming chart video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004. gamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004 almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the uk gaming industry s trade body. sales records were smashed by the top title of the year gta: san andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character cj into a crime boss. the game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. this feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the uk. although only released in november the sprawling story of guns gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. there were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600 000 copies. five titles including sony eyetoy play and ea s need for speed: underground 2 managed this feat according to figures compiled by chart-track for the entertainment and leisure software publishers association (elspa). electronic arts the world s biggest games publisher had 9 games in the top 20. 2004 was a stellar year said roger bennett director general of elspa. in a year with no new generation consoles being released the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender he said. part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. halo the sims driver need for speed fifa football burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. despite this fondness for older games doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. games linked to shrek the incredibles spider-man harry potter and lord of the rings were all in the top 20. elspa noted that sales of xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. however sony s playstation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. despite winning awards and rave reviews half-life 2 did not appear in the list. this was because it was only released on pc and compared to console titles sold in relatively small numbers. also the novel distribution system adopted by developer valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.lasting influence of legend charles ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music. his sound encompassed so many styles - blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes. compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devil s music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists. without charles it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman. unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock n roll greats including i ve got a woman (roy orbison elvis presley) and hallelujah i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what d i say charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style recording hoagy carmichael s sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack. he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than 40 years after its release his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson s i can t stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in 1972 he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people. on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than 20 years later he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word . there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes. i m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online. i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever.minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed a senior government figure has warned. economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on 28 december another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz the unit which produced 60% of yukos output had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal. baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. now officials are doing it. within days he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. mr gref a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz should it become a state-owned company must be privatized he said. today our government is ineffective and state companies as a result are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well. and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. if we follow that logic we should nationalise all businesses he said. many large russian companies particularly in the energy sector use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes. mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives mr gref told kommersant. we don t need simply to increase gdp but to improve its structure. instead of focusing on headline growth figures russia needed to focus on better institutions such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.howard s unfinished business he s not finished yet whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall. and indeed he wasn t. michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech at his party s spring conference in brighton to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an attack mongrel claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge. and here he was again moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause to make a personal ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory. one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine i was there. i did my bit. i played my part. i helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better . the speech which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the child of immigrants had been introduced by his son nick a trainee vicar who praised his father s honesty. i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me he said. mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra daughter larissa and stepson sholto. the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards. but mr howard s overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago. mr howard claimed with some justification that the tories campaign has got off to a great start . they have had labour on the back foot over immigration with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education. the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react. senior tories believe they are at long last starting to tap into the public mood cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter. their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline cleaner hospitals ( i mean how hard is it to keep a hospital clean ) and immigration ( it s not racist to impose limits on immigration ) - under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this they say contrasts with labour s negative campaigning such as its now infamous flying pigs poster. oliver letwin one of the men lampooned in the labour poster affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail. the peter hain mongrel attack he says is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product he claims of the tories setting the agenda. i have to say i don t understand what they are doing. the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock it doesn t seem to know what to do. a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which most analysts seem to agree will hinge on which party can get their core support out. it has been a fantastic few weeks said 20-year-old politics student nick vaughan. our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. i wouldn t be here if i didn t think we could. some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970 when ted heath behind in the polls and written off by the pundits snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party. they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001. we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn t happen said john murray of aldridge browhills conservatives. it was very disappointing. this time it really is different. whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on. blair is on the back foot. much of the credit for the tories recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard of australia s liberal party into a serial election winner. the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10. even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls they are still behind when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority they should really be ahead. but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper the party at least has reason to hope that like his australian namesake mr howard really isn t finished yet.fightstar take to the stage charlie simpson took his new band fightstar to the stage on friday night just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band busted. he was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the university of warwick. confirmation of busted s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day when simpson held a press conference in london with bandmates matt willis and james bourne. all three band members stressed that the break up was amicable although bourne admitted he was devastated to hear of simpson s departure. this has been a really difficult decision 19-year-old simpson revealed i hope the fans will understand. while simpson declared he would look back with pride on busted s enormous success his focus turned immediately to fightstar with friday s press conference coinciding with the start of the band s 13-date tour of the uk. fuelled by this news all 1 400 tickets to see charlie s first post-busted live appearance - at the university of warwick s student union - sold out rapidly. mike eccleshall the venue s promotions coordinator said: tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days but sales went mad after the news broke. we had completely sold out by 4pm. with queues outside the venue long and expectations high the pressure was on fightstar to impress. although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any busted concert. gone were the screaming girls to which simpson had become accustomed. support act brigade fronted by simpson s brother played a short set first and were met with general approval. when fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm however a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd. unfortunately the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as simpson s guitar amplifier failed to work. as sound technicians rushed to fix it other band members did their best to improvise. when they eventually got under way fightstar s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. far heavier and less commercial than busted s chart-topping pop-punk the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. warwick student helen clutterbuck admitted: i came to check out fightstar because of all the controversy. i ve never heard them before but i m pretty impressed. less impressed were fellow students ryan crabbe and gordon rennie who observed with fightstar charlie has clearly progressed from busted s sound but they re still not very inspiring. fightstar played for around 45 minutes showcasing material from their forthcoming ep called they liked you better when you were dead due for release in february.hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi-finals. hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets. the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt s exuberant on-court celebrations were not very good for the sport . and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he double-faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes. i just kept hanging in there. it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam. i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. it s a long way from holding that trophy up there but i m hanging in there. only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world. it s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.london hope over chepkemei london marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete susan chepkemei will still take part in this year s race on 17 april. chepkemei was suspended from all competition until the end of the year by athletics kenya after failing to report to a national training camp. we are watching it closely said london race director david bedford. there is a long way to go before the race and we are hoping the situation will be satisfactorily resolved. the camp in embu was to prepare for the iaaf world cross country championships later this month. chepkemei however took part and finished third in last sunday s world best 10k race in puerto rico. the 29-year-old has finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races as well as in november s new york city marathon.former ni minister scott dies former northern ireland minister sir nicholas scott has died at a london hospice his family has announced. the former conservative mp for kensington and chelsea died after a long illness diagnosed as alzheimer s. the 71-year-old served in northern ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of margaret thatcher. as a northern ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass ira escape from the maze in 1983. in education he encountered criticism over school closures and the future of the catholic training colleges. he also merged the new university of ulster and the ulster polytechnic to create the university of ulster. sir nicholas was a strong defender of the anglo-irish agreement and was held in esteem in dublin government and sdlp circles. but he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him minister of discord . after leaving northern ireland in a reshuffle he became a uk disability minister. sir nicholas was replaced as the member for kensington and chelsea by the flamboyant alan clark after being deselected by his constituency in december 1996. his deselection followed a series of scandals including being found slumped in the street by police during the tory party conference in bournemouth and taken back to his hotel. sir nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol. after his sacking he bitterly said that despite the support of cabinet ministers and tory backbenchers the eurosceptics in his constituency were absolutely determined to get rid of me . his colourful career also included a very public disagreement with daughter victoria over civil rights for the disabled. sir nicholas admitted he misled mps when he denied his department had been involved in wrecking tactics designed to kill the disability bill in 1994. victoria a lobbyist for disabled rights denounced her father s actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign. he joined the backbenches two months later.labour s cunningham to stand down veteran labour mp and former cabinet minister jack cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election. one of the few blair-era ministers to serve under jim callaghan he was given the agriculture portfolio when labour regained power in 1997. mr cunningham went on to become tony blair s cabinet enforcer . he has represented the constituency now known as copeland since 1970. mr blair said he was a huge figure in labour and a valued personal friend . during labour s long period in opposition mr cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs the environment and as trade spokesman. as agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over bse. he quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.barclays profits hit record level barclays the uk s third-biggest bank has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm. profits for the year to 31 december rose 20% to £4.6bn ($8.6bn). barclays chief john varley said the bank had caught the winds of a very strong world economy. earnings at barclays capital investment bank rose 25% to £1.04bn but investment in branch operations held back growth in its uk retail business. the group is the first of britain s five big banks to report 2004 results. according to analysts forecasts hsbc the biggest uk bank by stock market valuation will report profits of £9.4bn later this month. barclays results were in line with market expectations. its global investors wing made £347m an 82% jump on 2003 figures. profits at barclaycard rose by 5% to £801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base. the bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its uk retail division to £1.13bn. the outlook for 2005 is good as a result of balance sheet growth and investments made in 2004 mr varley said. barclays cautioned that growth this year may be slower than in 2004 on the back of softer us and chinese economies and the impact of interest rate rises on household spending in the uk. it added its bid to acquire a controlling stake in south africa s leading retail bank absa was being considered by regulatory authorities. speaking on bbc radio 4 mr varley declined to be drawn on reports that barclays had held merger talks with us bank wells fargo. a tie-up between barclays and california-based wells fargo would create the world s fourth biggest bank valued at $180bn. at 1405 gmt shares in barclays were trading down 0.67% at 590 pence. the headline numbers are in line but the story is costs said analyst alex potter at lehman brothers. they are a bit more aggressive than we had expected. the cost overshoot is not in barclays capital but in the uk bank.calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign. four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after a simmering row. and calder said: this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby. david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him. mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotland s club sides. he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs said calder. in fact i don t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived. but i don t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down. i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings. so i wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position. but in the wider picture what message does this send out he thought the work of scotland s coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult. matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here said calder. and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship. i am very very disappointed more than you can imagine. why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets toughvirus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card. the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus. like many other windows viruses zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. the virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads: happy holidays and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year. we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.johnson edges out rival sotherton jade johnson edged out rival kelly sotherton with her last effort to claim the aaas long jump title at the norwich union european indoor trials. olympic heptathlon bronze medallist sotherton led the event with her first leap of 6.43m - a personal best. but johnson who has not competed indoors for five years leapt to a life-time best of 6.50m in her last jump after four fouls. both johnson and sotherton passed the european championships qualifying mark. although sotherton s main aim in madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on olympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft. ireland s delivered a shock in the men s 200m as he stormed to his first major title in 21.01 seconds. british favourite chris lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion ireland s paul brizzel took third. there was some consolation for lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round - good enough to qualify for europe. two-time aaas champion allyn condon and ian mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats. there was plenty of hot action in the men s 60m hurdles where scotland s was vying for top spot with olympian andy turner. scott 22 smashed his personal best on the way to the final where he broke it again to win the aaas title in 7.58 seconds. turner finished second in 7.82 after previously setting a personal best on the 7.83 in the semi-finals while damien greaves did not finish the final. the trio of athletes have reached the european qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a call-up to the british squad. comfortably defended her 3 000m title clocking eight minutes 49.87 seconds to easily surpass the european qualifying mark. the european cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in europe this season and will go to madrid with high hopes. helen clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 9:05.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runners-up spot in a personal best of 9:05.73. in the men s 800m heats qualified fastest in the 800m heats to lay down a challenge to in-form . the welsh runner attacked the last 200m to come through ahead of james thie in one minute 49.87 seconds. mcilroy who is third in the european rankings eased across the finish in 1:50.87 to set up a showdown in sunday s final in sheffield. both watkins and mcilroy have already achieved the european qualifying mark. scotland s susan deacon stole s thunder in the final of the women s 200m. fraser became the fastest british woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in 23.68 seconds - though that time is outside the european standard. but deacon claimed her first aaas title over the distance edging fraser into second in 23.67. in the women s shot put veteran claimed her fourth aaas title with a throw of 15.27m. but that mark was not good enough for the 39-year-old to book her place at next month s european indoor championships in madrid. sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m. in the absence of injured british number one carl myerscough claimed the men s shot put title with a throw of 17.64m which was below the qualifying mark. sale s robert mitchell climbed to a season s best of 2.20m - just 3cm short of the european standard - to claim the british indoor high jump title. could only clear 2.16m to finish in fourth but the 27-year-old s disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in slovenia on tuesday. there was bad luck for british number one in the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at 5.45m. the aaas indoor title went instead to ashley swain who climbed to a season s best of 5.25m and ireland s taniesha scanlon set a new national record of 13.28m in the women s triple jump.snow patrol feted at irish awards snow patrol were the big winners in ireland s top music honours the meteor awards picking up accolades for best irish band

kicking before the make a success singer gary lightbody and drummer jonny quinn said. it has been good for us but also hard for us over the past six years. snow patrol will support u2 on their european tour later this year - but u2 were not nominated for best irish band and album.online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004. the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than 20 followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bush/kerry contest by highlighting a candidate s virtues or his vices. the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers. when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen. i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayan-born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games. the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way. video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country s problems could be solved by working together. it s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games. ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs. children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up. but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a must-have. dr frasca said: political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them. it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time. this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation. studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts. those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point it is a haphazard business. all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before. the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off. warrior within is a very slick package; the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences. it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti-climax. that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.new york rockers top talent poll new york electro-rock group the bravery have come top of the bbc news website s sound of 2005 poll to find the music scene s most promising new act. the bravery who have been compared to the cure and new order were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of 110 impartial critics and broadcasters. rock band keane won sound of 2004 while us rapper 50 cent topped sound of 2003. other new artists in this year s list include london indie group bloc party at second and uk rapper kano third. the bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including the libertines interpol and echo and the bunnymen. they were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single unconditional caused a huge buzz when it was released in the uk in november. singer sam endicott said he felt great about coming top of the sound of 2005 list. anyone that says they don t want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass a liar he said. one of the experts to tip the bravery was the times music critic paul connolly who said they were spiky but in love with pop . chris hawkins host of bbc 6 music s chart show said the band had great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound . the bravery are proof alone that new york city is still home to hot new talent he said. alison howe producer of tv show later... with jools holland booked the group to appear the day after seeing them at a west london pub. they played like they were headlining the main stage at glastonbury she said. great songs a good look a touch of attitude and a cracking live band. q magazine reviews editor ted kessler said they were pretty-boy new york clothes horses with an unusually nimble ear for concise yearning pop in the mould of duran duran or the strokes . other pundits to take part in the survey included bbc radio 1 dj trevor nelson nme editor conor mcnicholas top of the pops presenter fearne cotton glastonbury organiser emily eavis and bbc radio 2 music editor colin martin. elsewhere on the top 10 second-placed rock band bloc party began their rise after supporting franz ferdinand and uk garage mc kano in third is signed to the streets record label. us rapper the game is hip-hop great dr dre s latest protege while leeds group kaiser chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a britpop revival. in last year s survey keane were followed by franz ferdinand razorlight and joss stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point. boy band mcfly were sixth while scissor sisters who had the uk s best-selling album of 2004 were seventh. in the survey the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. the artists could be from any country and any musical genre but must not have had a uk top 20 single been a contestant on a tv talent show or already be famous for doing something else such as a soap actor. those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10.watchdog probes vivendi bond sale french stock market regulator amf has filed complaints against media giant vivendi universal its boss and another top executive. it believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information. amf has begun proceedings against vivendi its chief executive jean-rene fourtou and chief operating officer jean-bernard levy. vivendi advisor deutsche bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. deutsche bank which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors could face penalties if the complaint is upheld. vivendi has said it believes there is no legal basis for the complaints. the watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to privileged information surrounding the issue of the bonds. both men bought some of the bonds the associated press news agency reported. amf is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in vivendi s us assets from investor marvin davis at the time of the bond sale. vivendi however has said that the information was public knowledge as mr davis offer for the us assets had already been rejected by vivendi s board. amf is also looking into whether the executives knew that vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy british telecom s shares in cegetel. vivendi has rejected the charge saying the decision to buy the cegetel shares was no more than a possibility of which the public was perfectly aware at the time of the bond issue. back in december vivendi and its former chief executive jean-marie messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; £690 000) by amf. the fines came after a 15-month probe into allegations that the media giant misled investors after a costly acquisition programme went wrong.cable offers video-on-demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up. movies from sony pictures walt disney touchstone miramax columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer. the service is similar to sky plus as users can pause fast forward and rewind content but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. it could sound the death knell for some tv channels telewest predicts. it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years said telewest chief executive eric tveter. video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv. there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside said philip snalune director of products at telewest. telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. during the year the service will be extended to all cable regions. films will range in price from £1 or £2 for archived movies to £3.50 for current releases. new releases initially on offer will include 50 first dates kill bill: volume 2 gothika and the station agent. in addition ntl is offering children s programmes adult content music video and concerts. telewest will launch similar services later in the year. ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders casualty top gear and antiques roadshow. the bbc is trialling a similar service offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc. for telewest it is the beginning of a £20m investment in tv-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (pvr). pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes. satellite customers without pvr cannot pause rewind or fast forward their programmes. with both services on offer from telewest mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky. we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and pvr he said. video rental stores may also have to watch their back. video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient he said. ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand. pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand said a spokesman for the company. video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls he added. adam thomas an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish. while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and if marketed correctly this could help them eat into sky s lead he said.grammys honour soul star charles the memory of soul legend ray charles dominated the music world s leading music ceremony on sunday as he was given eight posthumous grammy awards. charles who died in 2004 got honours including record and album of the year while alicia keys and actor jamie foxx performed a musical tribute to him. r&b star keys won four awards herself at the grammy ceremony

trophies. but elvis costello who had four nominations and joss stone and franz ferdinand who were both up for three awards got nothing. beach boys veteran brian wilson was another first-time winner - for best rock instrumental performance. it represents triumph and achievement in music that i feel that i deserved and i m really glad i won he said. a live recording of composer john adams 11 september tribute on the transmigration of souls performed by the new york philharmonic won three classical prizes. and former us president bill clinton picked up the second grammy of his career winning the spoken word award for the audio version of his autobiography my life.clarke to unveil immigration plan new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on monday. home secretary charles clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. tony blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no magic bullet . the tories say labour is acting too late while the lib dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. the government s new five-year plan is designed to show how labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election expected to be held in may. ministers deny they have been spurred into action by tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done. instead they say the plans are part of an evolving process aimed at winning public confidence. mr clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants families and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. the prime minister on sunday said immigration would be toughened up to ensure only those immigrants with skills the uk really needs will be granted work permits. but he rejected the tories call for a quota on economic migrants saying no arbitrary figure could reflect the uk s needs. mr blair told bbc radio 4 s westminster hour: we should cut the number or increase it depending on the country s needs... the public are worried about this they are worried rightly because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system. but he defended the uk s current regime saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse. tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work argued mr blair. he said: we will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing britain s asylum seekers in some other country because no such other country exists. conservative shadow home secretary david davis said the government had failed to remove 250 000 failed asylum seekers from the uk and limits on economic migrants had been a shambles . what we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said labour was right to reject the tories idea of quotas on asylum. but he said it was yet to be seen if mr clarke could deliver a fair and efficient asylum system .labour battle plan hides blair the tories have accused tony blair of being terrified of scrutiny after labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election. in a break with tradition the party will ditch the leader s battle bus and daily press briefings in westminster. instead mr blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party s message. labour election chief alan milburn denied the party was trying to hide the prime minister. he promised the most positive and upbeat election campaign labour has ever run . but tory co-chairman liam fox said labour s plans showed mr blair was terrified of facing proper scrutiny . at a time when the british people are looking for more accountability and openness this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question what have they got to hide the general election is widely expected next may and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. mr milburn said the economy would take centre stage in labour s campaign in what would be a watershed election and the last stand of the thatcherites . mr milburn said labour s slogan would be britain is working - don t let the tories wreck it. the tone of the campaign said mr milburn would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. the approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters he said. mr milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy. i m not privy to everybody s diary he said. mr brown has headed labour s preparations for previous polls but mr milburn is taking that role this time. in a break with the past labour will not hold a daily news conference in london. it will not be a battle bus style campaign either he said. in previous elections each party leader has had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper television and radio reporters to staged campaign events around the country. mr milburn said labour s media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. mr milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up face-to-face meetings between ministers and the electorate. former downing street media chief alastair campbell is also returning to advise labour on media strategy and campaigning. mr milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether david blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. liberal democrat chief executive lord rennard suggested labour was avoiding news conferences in london because it wanted less scrutiny of its record and proposals. tony blair seems to have disappeared from labour leaflets and broadcasts he said. in contrast charles kennedy will feature prominently in the liberal democrat campaign right across the country.halo 2 heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company sandvine. it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo 2. the 9 november traffic explosion has continued into december said sandvine. service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. as well as being a popular single-player title halo 2 can be connected to microsoft s subscription-based broadband network xbox live. gamers who want to play online can create their own clan or team and take on others to see how well they compare. but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said sandvine s chief technology officer marc morin. in a bid to cope and ease congestion providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call he said. isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games he added. one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is lag in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest lag . analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said lindsay schroth an analyst with research firm the yankee group. in the competitive broadband environment operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming she said. in countries such as korea which has high levels of fast net connections to homes online gaming is hugely popular.fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday s 19-13 six nations loss to ireland in dublin. mark cueto s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes. [i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport. we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t. south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather. kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson. it is how we use the technology. it is there and it should be used. i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both and they both looked tries. we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that. we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory. i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well. josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players. we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations. england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks. the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may. after a nine week break the wru then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. he added: we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure. moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued. the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. pickering added: it s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important. we ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.booming markets shed few tears the market former british government minister michael heseltine once said has no morality. and indeed stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka more comprehensively affected the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index a measure of global stock market performance hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the bbc global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts. in fact the markets are being perfectly rational. for a start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in for example the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally. second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings a small sri lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week. more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the 1993 des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware* found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another 18% felt themselves better off. although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hard-hit do indeed recover the authors concluded. but disasters have a vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors. in particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact again the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks the colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan s banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before 11 september 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings one bombay trader said this week. but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.de niro completes box office coup robert de niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the uk and us film charts with two different films at the same time. comedy sequel meet the fockers in which he stars with ben stiller dustin hoffman and barbra streisand shot to the top of the uk chart at the weekend. it took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two closer. assault on precinct 13

the parents. it is a big leap to his role in hide and seek a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter s imaginary friend turns nasty. in the uk box office chart meet the fockers pushed closer off the top spot while police action movie assault on precinct 13 starring rapper ja rule made £750 000 in its first weekend. london underground thriller creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy sideways which got five oscar nominations last week entered in eighth place. the oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans choices at cinemas. leading contenders the aviator million dollar baby and ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.youssou n dour wins music prize senegalese musician youssou n dour has

donation to the party by the billionaire - he has contributed more than £10m since 1999. david sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the vision to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for britain. general secretary matt carter said it was a fantastic gift that would help labour fight and win the election . through the generosity of david sainsbury and other labour supporters labour will be campaigning hard to take britain forward and to stop the tories taking us back mr carter said. lord sainsbury added: i am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the labour party because i believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for britain. the 64-year-old latest donation follows a £2.5m gift to the party in 2003. lord sainsbury was created a life peer in 1997 a year before he was appointed as minister for science.healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations. healey who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season. i definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc. we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me. healey who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival. i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before he said. i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice. but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things. that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try. i caught cozza s eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled. healey twice a heineken cup winner believes last sunday s match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game he recalled. there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way. the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugby s version of rocky ii . there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done he added. it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.a november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world. that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand. clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney. there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%. while that bodes well for rugby as a whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title. that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays. who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road. their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them will lay down quietly. dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper. the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff a fourth title in six years is within reach. are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style. while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency. but the manner of new zealand s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts. who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.african double in edinburgh world 5000m champion eliud kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the view from great edinburgh cross country. the kenyan who was second when newcastle hosted the race last year was in front from the outset. ethiopian duo gebre gebremariam and dejene berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him but kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. gavin thompson was the first briton in 12th place while nick mccormick held of his british rivals to win the 4km race. the morpeth harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended mike skinner and andrew baddeley s hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. my training has gone so well i wasn t really worried about the opposition asi knew i was in great shape said mccormick who now hopes to earn a 1 500m place in the british team for the world championships in helsinki. in the women s race ethiopia s tirunesh dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion benita johnson to retain her title. australian johnson who shocked her african rivals in brussels last march looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. but world 5000m champion dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. britons kathy butler and hayley yelling were out of contention early on.o driscoll/gregan lead aid stars ireland s brian o driscoll will lead the northern hemisphere team in the irb rugby aid match at twickenham. o driscoll heads a star-studded cast for the contest to raise funds for the tsunami appeal. the south will be led by george gregan one of four wallabies alongside five springboks and four all blacks including captain tana umaga. south african flanker schalk burger has shaken off a leg injury to take his place in the starting line-up. he will join fellow springboks john smit cobus visagie and victor matfield in the south pack with jacque fourie among the centres. the north side have been hit by the withdrawals of scotland duo gordon bulloch and chris cusiter plus france captain fabien pelous. but leicester s england centre ollie smith has been added to the squad giving him an opportunity to impress lions coach sir clive woodward who takes charge of the north side. i think it s fantastic for ollie tigers coach john wells told bbc radio leicester. he was probably going to have the weekend off this week and i hope clive gets the chance to see the qualities that leicester and england have been seeing all year. woodward will also assess other potential lions candidates such as scotland pair simon taylor and chris paterson wales scrum-half dwayne peel and ireland lock paul o connell. i m looking forward to working with such outstanding players woodward said. both teams are fielding top-quality sides and i really hope that the rugby public and community get behind this game to raise as much money as possible for such a deserving cause. despite the withdrawal of wales wing rhys williams who is required for the blues celtic league match with munster three other members of their six nations squad - ceri sweeney john yapp and jonathan thomas - will also play. not only it is for a good cause but it gives these players the opportunity to play with and against some of the best players in the world said wru general manager steve lewis. supporters can watch the teams train for free at twickenham on friday 4 march. woodward will put his north team through their paces at 1030 gmt with the south side coached by former wallabies coach rod macqueen due at the stadium at 1330. c paterson (scotland) b cohen (england) b o

            "beijingers fume over parking fees choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. car ownership has risen fast in recent years and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable said wang yan an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state-run china daily newspaper. mr wang who is in charge of collecting car parking fees said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones. sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage. it wants them to use public transport and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly but it is not always secure. mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games.turkey knocks six zeros off lira turkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy. the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note worth $15. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which as recently as 2001 was as high as 70%. inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving. the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 january. from that point the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union. on an everyday level it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike. the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years said sureyya serdengecti head of the turkish central bank. the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years. the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. meanwhile the economy is expanding at a healthy rate with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country s economic progress two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey s accession talks. the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community. the turkish lira has been like funny money tevfik aksoy chief turkish economist for deutsche bank told associated press. now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency. however some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced. if a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease shop owner hayriye evren told associated press. this will definitely affect people psychologically.indy buys into india paper irish publishing group independent news & media is buying up a 26% stake in indian newspaper company jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m). jagran publishes india s top-selling daily newspaper the hindi-language dainik jagran which has been in circulation for 62 years. news of the deal came as the group announced that its results would meet market forecasts. the company reported strong revenue growth across all its major markets. group advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year the group said with overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% year-on-year. this was helped by the positive impact of compact newspaper editions in ireland and the uk it said. 2004 has proven to be an important year for independent news & media said chief executive sir anthony o reilly. our simple aim at independent is to be the low cost producer in every region in which we operate. i am confident that we will show a meaningful increase in earnings for 2005. meanwhile the group made no comment about the future of the independent newspaper despite recent speculation that sir anthony had held talks with potential buyers over a stake in the daily publication. he has consistently denied suggestions that the independent and the independent on sunday are up for sale. buy it is understood that the recent success of the smaller edition of the independent which has pushed circulation up by 20% to 260 000 has prompted interest from industry rivals with daily mail & general trust tipped as the most likely suitor. the loss-making newspaper is not expected to reach break-even until 2006.cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them. in london alone over the past six months more than 63 000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost 5 000 laptops and 5 800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown and we trust more of our lives to them we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years. this has left londoners or those travelling by cab in the capital as the world s best at losing laptops according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki oslo munich paris stockholm copenhagen chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else. equally phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton s growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp a dog a hamster and a baby.apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold 10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire a research director at analyst gartner told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in sealing off the market from competition so far. they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design function and the software are very impressive he said. he added that the threat from others was always present however. creative other microsoft-partnered devices real sony and so on are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year he said. its second-generation models like the creative zen micro photo is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board. digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004 according to the record industry with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music which they can do with high-capacity storage devices like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.first look at playstation 3 chip some details of the chip inside sony s playstation 3 have been revealed. sony ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so-called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. as well as being inside the playstation 3 the chip will also be used inside high-definition tvs and powerful computers. in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony. current pc architecture is nearing its limits.have hackers recruited your pc more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses. the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50 000 hijacked home computers. data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them. the detailed look at zombie or bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. while bot nets have been known about for some time estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely. to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. the research found that once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off. the months of surveillance revealed that the different bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. many are used as relays for spam to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses. but the research team found that many are put to very different uses. during the monitoring period the team saw bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. using a bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. other bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. criminals also seem to be starting to use bot nets for mass identity theft to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. leveraging the power of several thousand bots it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly said the researchers. even in unskilled hands it should be obvious that bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions the firm has said. the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer eliot spitzer and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds. the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.no charges against tv s cosby us comedian bill cosby will not face charges stemming from an allegation of sexual misconduct. authorities in philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the woman s allegations regarding an alleged incident in january 2004. the woman reported the allegations to canadian authorities last month. cosby s lawyer walter m phillips jr said the comedian was pleased with the decision. he looks forward to moving on with his life he said. district attorney bruce l castor jr who was in charge of the case said that detectives could find no instance where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence. he also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward and she had had further contact with cosby during that time were also factors in his decision. the unidentified woman s lawyer dolores m troiani said her client was likely to sue the comedian. i think that s the only avenue open to her. she felt as we did that it s a very strong case and she was telling the truth. she also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations. cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the us. he was a successful stand-up before hosting the children s show fat albert and the cosby kids and starring in the cosby show one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s.greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic 100m title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer. he had to settle for bronze in greece behind fellow american justin gatlin and francis obikwelu of portugal. it really hurts to look at that medal. it was my mistake. i lost because of the things i did said greene who races in birmingham on friday. it s never going to happen again. my goal - i m going to win the worlds. greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind gatlin who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. in my semi-final race i should have won the race but i was conserving energy. that s when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i didn t know he was there. i believe that s what put me in lane seven in the final and while i was in lane seven i couldn t feel anything in the race. i just felt like i was running all alone. i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me. greene was also denied olympic gold in the 4x100m men s relay when he could not catch britain s mark lewis-francis on the final leg. the kansas star is set to go head-to-head with lewis-francis again at friday s norwich union grand prix. the pair contest the 60m the distance over which greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. he then has another indoor meeting in france before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in helsinki in august. greene believes gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in finland. but he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. there s always someone else coming. i think when i was coming up i would say there was me and ato (boldon) in the young crowd greene said. now you ve got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest. the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed. in total the tfc tower has 61 lifts 34 of them double-deckers and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december. the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include: - a pressure control system which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers preventing ear popping - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us said masayuki shimono president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955. as such it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition when the record was 426m per minute or 25.6 km/h less than half the speed of the new record said hein le roux specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.digital uk driven by net and tv the uk s adoption of digital tv and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in europe according a report by jupiter research. but the uk still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. the most digitally sophisticated europeans in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles tv net and cameras are the scandinavians. about 14 million households in the uk 60% have digital tv according to the communications regulator ofcom. the least digital of the european nations was greece in 17th position according to the digital life index. scandinavian countries sweden denmark and norway came out top in the report but there were some differences in technology trends. the european digital life index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today but across europe there is no single digital lifestyle said nate elliott jupiter analyst. consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries. although there are differences between different european nations the gap between them is closing the report concluded. the trend for gadgets and technologies such as digital video recorders (dvr) broadband and video-on-demand will continue across europe he added. more than six million uk households now have broadband net. by the middle of 2005 it is estimated that 50% of all uk net users will be on broadband. cable company ntl is trialling faster adsl (asymmetric digital subscriber line) broadband technology using adsl2+ which can give speeds of 18mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1mbps or 2mbps. bt is set to trial the technology later in the year. super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition tv (hdtv) and video-on-demand already very popular in france and other european countries. a separate survey by gmipoll last week found that globally people s appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. the poll of 20 000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more

handheld gaming gadget sony s playstation portable goes on sale in the us on thursday. the entertainment device which also stores images music and video is intended to compete with nintendo s ds released earlier this month in the uk. gamers have been queuing outside shops across the us to get their hands on the gadget which costs $250 (about £132). the first million sold will come with the spider-man 2 film on umd sony s own disc format for the device. the psp can be linked up with others for multiplayer gaming via a wireless connection. sony has touted the machine as the walkman of the 21st century and has sold more than 800 000 units in japan since its launch there last year. but it faces stiff competition from the nintendo ds which sold more than the gamecube in its first few days on release in europe. it too allows for multiplayer gaming over the air. nintendo dominates the handheld market with more than a 90% share of the market in the us alone. the gizmondo combined media player phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the uk last week. it hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too. the story of the psp is it s not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device said michael pachter analyst at wedbush morgan securities. he told the reuters news agency that he expected sony to sell about 10 million psps in enough time to rival apple s ipod. there is no date for the psp s release in europe yet. sony has promised to have a million units ready for its us launch but there are fears demand may not be met. it also said it expected to ship three million psps worldwide by the end of its fiscal year ending 31 march. the machine s european launch was put back a few months last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its us launch as well as satisfying the japanese market. the psp has almost as much processing power in it as the playstation 2 console. hundreds of gamers gathered at us shops some waiting for more than 36 hours to be the first to get their hands on the gadget. a spokesman for one us shop said it expected the device to sell out on its first day. the 24 games for the mini console include ape academy formula one wipeout pure and fired up. movie studios including lions gate entertainment and disney have also announced forthcoming film titles that will be made available on the umd format.us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december boosted by strong car sales. seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month compared to 0.1% a month earlier boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed 8% for the year the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999 the commerce department added. the gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started. the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion however if automotives are excluded from december s data retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well rising 2.2%. but as well as hitting the shops more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. however analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. consumers for now remain willing to spend freely sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings ubs economist maury harris told reuters. retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. looking ahead analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 000 the highest rate since september. however long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.trade gap narrows as exports rise the uk s trade gap narrowed in november helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the european union. according to the office for national statistics the difference between what the uk exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn) down from october s £3.6bn. overall uk exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. the deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn down from october s £5bn. during november the uk exported £16.9bn worth of goods but imported £21.5bn. the cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003. november saw an improvement in export levels to both the european union and the rest of the world the office for national statistics (ons) said. eu exports rose 2% fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. non-eu exports shot up 7.5% with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars consumer durables and chemicals. the export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. non-eu imports rose 3% but the growth in goods entering the uk from the eu slowed to 0.5%. the uk s deficit with the eu fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn while its non-eu shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in october. the country s surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. paul dales uk economist for capital economics said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. however he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. the figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor he said. there have been some very encouraging signs that the uk export recovery is starting to take hold. but there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware. the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool. the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft s windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100 000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers often without users knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and on average each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec mcafee trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft s two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.mobile music challenges ipod age nokia and microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets while sony ericsson has unveiled its phone walkman and motorola is working on an itunes phone. can mobile phones replace the mp3 player in your pocket the music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. ease of use relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of mp3 players. full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. but the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated mp3 players are numbered. gilles babinet chief executive of mobile music firm musiwave said: music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music. musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and mr babinet said the industry was enjoying definite momentum. but there are hurdles to overcome. mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival apple s 60gb ipod. but the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. we are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices jonas guest vice president for entertainment at nokia told the bbc news website. but will mobiles become mere storage devices one of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while pcs are used for downloading said mr babinet we don t want people to cast aside their pcs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems explained mr guest. you must enable people to transfer music from a pc to a handset and vice versa. one of the key elements of the nokia and microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a pc. microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. songs can be downloaded on pc or mobile and transferred between the platforms. the line between online and wireless is going to blur predicted ted cohen senior vice president of digital development and distribution at emi. he said: the market is more regional in its maturity. in asia it is beyond belief. the majority of our digital revenues in asia comes from mobiles. in north america it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in europe. emi currently offers its entire 200 000 download catalogue for use by both by pcs and mobile phones. mr cohen said: it s going to be just as important to connect through 3g or wireless as it is through your pc. we want music to be a continuum. the seamless experience of mobiles and pc downloads is approaching he predicted. mr babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over pcs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. getting music from your pc onto a device is not an easy experience. you have to switch the pc on load the operating system load the program buy the music download the music and then transfer the music. all of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone. he said the mobile phone s billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group. certainly we have a problem with battery memory and bandwidth. but it s not about the current status. it s about the potential. you will have all of your music on your mobile. all three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. mr cohen said: i can send you the song and it is either billed to me or i send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep it is billed to you. it s a social phenomenon. mr babinet said: today you use radio and tv to discover music. tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device - the mobile.fiat mulls ferrari market listing ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat s carmaking operations the financial times has reported. it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with gm about fiat s ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo fiat s car business is making a loss. under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a 56% stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. it considered floating ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about 10 000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003. fiat italy s largest private sector employer did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.dvd review: spider-man 2 it s a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man 2 breaks that rule in two. it s not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling. the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects. this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel. sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man. now is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on 24 december and you won t see them again until early in the new year. it s not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne s earlier films: there s no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras. it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that s been long awaited on dvd. this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma s (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it s all as camp and gaudy as you remember. but it s also a disappointment. the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omission though is that there are no extras. that s particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.strong demand triggers oil rally crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand. the international energy agency (iea) warned demand for opec s crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. the iea raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80 000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. us light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10 while brent crude in london gained $1.32 to $44.45. the paris-based iea watchdog which advises industrialized nations on energy policy said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from china and other asian countries. the fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on wednesday which were triggered by large falls in us crude supplies following a cold spell in north america in january. the us department of energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. on top of that ongoing problems for beleaguered russian oil giant yukos have also prompted the iea to revise its output estimates from russia - a major non-opec supplier. i think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level said energy analyst orin middleton of barclays capital.ministers deny care sums wrong ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated. a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure. the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute. dubious assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022 the report warned. it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland: we don t think we got our sums wrong. obviously we will examine the findings of this new report along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. and we are absolutely committed to doing that. but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy there were questions which needed to be answered and if necessary sums redone. she said: serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive. we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.disney backs sony dvd technology a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost. film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony s blu-ray disc technology but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats blu-ray developed by sony and others and toshiba s hd-dvd have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promise very high quality pictures and sound as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight. the current battle for hollywood s hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month paramount universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format hd-dvd high-definition discs. those studios currently produce about 45% of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association whose members also include technology companies dell samsung and matsushita. twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. if fox decided to go with blu-ray too it would mean the format would have a 47% share of dvd content. disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan expected in 2006. universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in 2005 and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn £1.5bn) by 2010.euronext poised to make lse bid pan-european group euronext is poised to launch a bid for the london stock exchange uk media reports say. last week the lse rejected a takeover proposal from german rival deutsche boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. the lse which saw its shares rise 25% said the bid undervalued the business. euronext - formed after the brussels paris and amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. the lse europe s biggest stock market is a key prize listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion. euronext already has a presence in london due to its 2001 acquisition of london-based options and futures exchange liffe. trades on the lse are cleared via clearnet in which euronext has a quarter stake. euronext which also operates an exchange in lisbon last week appointed ubs and abn amro as additional advisors. it is also working with morgan stanley. despite the rejection of the deutsche boerse bid last week werner seifert chief executive of the frankfurt-based exchange may well come back with an improved offer. it has long wanted to link up with london and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. responding to the lse s rebuff deutsche boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits and that it still hoped to make a cash bid. last week the lse said not only was the bid undervalued but that it had been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented . however it has indicated it is open for further talks. meanwhile german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seifert s negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german jobs. many analysts believe german boerse has more financial firepower than euronext if it came to a bidding war.clyde 0-5 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi-final but only after a nervy and testing first half. the home side s craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on saving from bellamy chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from bryson but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy s effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net. maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage - thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out. halliwell mensing bollan balmer potter sheridan (burns 61) arbuckle

wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football. anelka 25 is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club. the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine: i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. i think i will always choose football if a great club makes me an offer. he added: to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. if we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it s impossible to progress. if i am going to score goals and not win there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up. anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him. i am in talks to sign an extension to my contract he said. i am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. playing for eighth place is good but i miss the champions league. i won it with real madrid in 2000 and i need to be playing in it - and i should be playing in it. i m not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. but i don t blame anyone. it s a bit my fault.campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenal s sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners bitter and personal . past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday. it is just more bitter and personal against united the defender told the guardian newspaper. there s an edge. after all that has happened if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins especially because of how we lost to them up there. last october arsenal lost 2-0 at old trafford which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis with the gunners winning only three of their next 10 games. it had a psychological impact on us but again because of the way we were defeated added the 30-year-old referring to a controversial penalty award for united s first goal. that was far more upsetting losing like that because they just seem to get away with it. you try and balance out over the course of a season but i ve had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder. with tensions spilling over afterwards - united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game said campbell. we are up for this one. speaking on his long-term plans campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. i m 30 now and in five years time i won t be in this country - that s definite. italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. i m starting a little with french of course.ad firm wpp s profits surge 15% uk advertising giant wpp has posted larger-than-expected annual profits and predicted that it will outperform the market in 2005. pre-tax profits rose 15% from a year ago to reach £546m ($1.04bn) ahead of average analysts forecasts of £532m. revenues were £4.3bn while the firm s operating margins were 14.1% which it said could reach 14.8% by 2006. during the year wpp bought us rival grey global creating a giant big enough to rival sector leader omnicom. chief executive martin sorrell on friday told reuters news agency that wpp had submitted a proposal for united business media s nop world market research unit. analysts say the unit sell could sell for up to £350m. wpp in recent years has also bought firms such as ogilvy & mather and cordiant communications. it also includes the firms young & rubicam and j walter thompson. events such as the olympics helped boost wpp s profits in 2004. the company said the us congressional elections and the fifa world cup are likely to present advertising opportunities in the near future. the long-term outlook looks very favourable because of media and technology developments and the strength of the us economy wpp said.circuit city gets takeover offer circuit city stores the second-largest electronics retailer in the us has received a $3.25bn (£1.7bn) takeover offer. the bid has come from boston-based private investment firm highfields capital management which already owns 6.7% of circuit city s shares. shares in the retailer were up 19.6% at $17.04 in tuesday morning trading in new york following the announcement. highfield said that it intends to take the virginia-based firm private. such a transformation would eliminate the public-company transparency into the company s operating strategy that is uniquely damaging in a highly competitive industry where circuit city is going head-to-head with a tough and entrenched rival highfield said. one analyst suggested that a bidding battle may now begin for the company. bill armstrong a retail analyst at cl king & associates said he expected to see other private investment firms come forward for circuit city. the retailer is debt free with a good cash flow despite the fact that it is said to be struggling to keep up with market leader best buy and cut-price competition from the likes of wal-mart said mr armstrong.safety alert as gm recalls cars the world s biggest carmaker general motors (gm) is recalling nearly 200 000 vehicles in the us on safety grounds according to federal regulators. the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) said the largest recall involves 155 465 pickups vans and sports utility vehicles (suvs). this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years gm said. those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche express kodiak silverade and suburban; the gmc savana sierra and yukon. the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash it warned. gm is also recalling 19 924 cadillac xlr coupes srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the 2004 model year. this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures requiring more braking. in addition the car giant is calling back 17 815 buick raniers chevrolet trailblazers gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. however gm stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. news of the recall follows an announcement last month that gm expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. the world s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its european business weak us sales and now a product recall. in january gm said higher healthcare costs in north america and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.borders 19-20 ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night. a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase. the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart however when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory. borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time said mccall. in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries. morton moffat macrae hore berthinussen warnock moore thomson ford douglas blair stewart gray brown mcentee. kay parr mcgee rennick weston millar pattison.

post-quake gloom indonesian indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs. investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on asia s listed firms. obviously with a lot of loss of life a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess bury the people and find the missing said abn amro s eddie wong. [but] it s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense. india s bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday. expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday. in hong kong the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of south east asia. in sri lanka some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. sri lanka s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004. thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome. in the affected provinces he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level said naris chaiyasoot director general at the ministry s fiscal policy office. in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth according to a government spokesman. our nation is in peril here said ahmed shaheed the chief government spokesman. he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. the maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. it won t be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp he said. in the last few years we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days a few minutes. shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged and a similar number have suffered significant damage. however many experts including the world bank have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. in part this is because of its scale and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. calculators will have to wait said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday. the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.weak dollar hits reuters revenues at media group reuters slipped 11% during 2004 mainly due to the weakness of the dollar the group said. the company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004. reuters beat profit forecasts posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier. reuters also beat its savings target for 2004 delivering £234m of cuts. under its three-year fast forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save £220m during the 12 months to 31 december. reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier. the news and financial data seller said the year had begun well adding it expected further gradual improvement in the second quarter of the year after good january sales. it added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from fleet street to new headquarters in london at canary wharf. improving customer relationships more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005 chief executive tom glocer said adding the company was beginning to look beyond recovery to growth .imf cuts german growth estimate the international monetary fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the german economy from 1.8% to 0.8% the financial times deutschland reported. the imf will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6% the newspaper reported. the german economy has been faltering with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone. the imf s draft world economic outlook - due to be published in april - would point to a marked deterioration in germany s economy the ft report said. in september the imf had said that german growth for the current year would be 1.8%. the imf has also revised eurozone forecasts the paper said taking into account high oil prices the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world s leading economies. europe s economic difficulties have been highlighted by the organisation for economic co-operation and development which argued in a report published on tuesday that the continent could only achieve us living standards by freeing up its labour markets. the eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery james carrick an economist with abn amro told the newspaper. it is too dependant on the rest of the world.cannabis hopes for drug firm a prescription cannabis drug made by uk biotech firm gw pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in canada. the drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (ms). a few weeks ago shares in gw pharma lost a third of their value after uk regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug s benefits. but now canadian authorities have said the sativex drug will be considered for approval. approximately 50 000 people in canada have been diagnosed with ms and 85 000 people are suffering from the condition in the uk. many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms. now gw pharma s sativex mouth spray could be legally available to ms sufferers in canada within the next few months. this will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world representing a landmark for gw pharma and for patients with ms. final approval in canada should now be little more than a formality analysts said and the company expects full approval for sativex early in 2005. we are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from health canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for sativex in canada in the early part of 2005 said gw pharma executive chairman dr geoffrey guy. the uk government granted gw pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the english countryside. despite hopes of regulatory approval last year a series of delays has put back sativex s launch in the uk. the latest news sent shares in gw pharma up 8.5p or 8.1% to 113.5p.muslim police stops more likely uk muslims should accept that people of islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police a home office minister has said. hazel blears said innocent muslims would be targeted because of the search for islamic extremists. qualifications for religious leaders to enter the uk could also be made tougher she told a commons inquiry. her comments have been described as irresponsible and outrageous by the islamic human rights commission (ihrc). the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of islam or who are falsely hiding behind islam the salford mp told the commons home affairs committee. it means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the muslim community. it was a reality that should be recognised she said. if a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area she added. on ministers of religions such as imams she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community should be demanded. last year ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak english to a certain level. ihrc chairman massoud shadjareh accused ms blears of playing an islamophobia card in the run-up to a general election. she is demonising and alienating our community he said. it is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. this sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists. later the prime minister s official spokesman urged people to put ms blears comments into context. the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community but that was not what was happening the spokesman said. what is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. it is not aimed at a particular community it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community he added. statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the uk since the 11 september attacks only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were muslim he added figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics. figures showed that for 2003/2004 asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. separate figures on police searches in england and wales carried out under the terrorism act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. in 2003/2004 12.5% searches under the laws were on asian people even though they make up 4.7% of the population. last july the police were accused of islamophobia by muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.celebrities get to stay in jungle all four contestants still remain in i m a celebrity ... get me out of here as no evictions were made on the television show on saturday. contestants paul burrell joe pasquale janet street-porter and fran cosgrave were told by hosts ant and dec. natalie appleton s decision to quit the show last monday had given them all a stay of execution the group were told. model sophie anderton was the last person to be voted off the itv1 show set in the australian jungle. the four remaining stars will do a joint bushtucker trial on sunday. former all saints singer natalie appleton 31 walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called bushtucker trial. the celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp. appleton had endured a torrid time during the programme including a well-publicised row with sophie anderton. and on 26 november singer brian harvey quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with janet street-porter.uk debut for kevin spacey movie hollywood stars kevin spacey and kate bosworth attended the british premiere of new film beyond the sea in london s leicester square on thursday. spacey 45 wrote directed and starred in the film inspired by the life of 1950s croooner bobby darin. this is my tribute to someone i think was a remarkable talent said spacey who as darin sings all 18 songs on the film soundtrack. bosworth 21 plays darin s wife - real life hollywood actress sandra dee. i knew absolutely nothing about bobby darin before this film but now i m a huge fan said bosworth who attended the premiere with british boyfriend orlando bloom. there is darkness and tragedy in the story and it was a dream for me to land this part. actress sandra dee continues to live in los angeles as a virtual recluse but has given her approval to the biopic. she called me last week and said she loved it said spacey who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band westlife. spacey a double oscar-winner has long been fascinated by the story of singer bobby darin. the voice behind mack the knife dream lover and beyond the sea fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life. bobby darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known and yet because he died young he s been kind of forgotten said spacey at the premiere. making this film was the most fun i ve ever had in my entire life. the movie also stars british actors bob hoskins and brenda blethyn as darin s mother.t-mobile bets on pocket office t-mobile has launched its latest pocket office third-generation (3g) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data the device selects the fastest one itself. the mda iv released in the summer is an upgrade to the company s existing smartphone the 2.5g/wi-fi mda iii. it reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. the device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer or as a conventional clamshell phone. the microsoft mobile phone with two cameras and a qwerty keyboard reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year such as motorola s mpx. one in five european workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office rene obermann t-mobile s chief executive told a press conference at the 3gsm trade show in cannes. he added: what they need is their office when they are out of the office. t-mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls office in a pocket devices with 100 000 mdas sold in europe already. in response to demand t-mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped blackberry to its mobile range. reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the uk using its wi-fi hotspots. it said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12 300 to 20 000. it also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services such as the uk s london to brighton service to provide commuters a fast net connection too. the service which has been developed with southern trains nomad digital (who provide the technology) begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early march to the end of april. a full service is set to follow in the summer. wi-fi access points will be connected to a wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. brian mcbride managing director of t-mobile in the uk said: we see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move. we are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey. he said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services such as that offered on gner trains did not offer yet. mr obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in cannes france for the 3gsm which runs from 14 to 17 february.sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries. some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5 000 processors each sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each. although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost $12 (£6.30) because it had used up 12 hours worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme. officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios or large rural estates which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure. the firm whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters they plan to seize 12 900 acres (5 200 hectares) from the 32 000 acre (13 000 hectare) farm. officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. as a consequence the government has taken action. controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century. critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land. the company pointed out that the farm which employs 300 workers provides meat solely for the venezuelan market. last month the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear . under president chavez the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture name and personal details the new seafarers identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenti-corp s ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.media gadgets get moving pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005 according to industry experts. last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player the samsung yepp the iriver pmc-100 and the archos av400 series among others. but this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them. archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday. dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430 it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said henri crohas chief of archos. and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time. archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people s pockets after the mobile. unlike windows-based players the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as tvs as well as playback. the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device. recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces primarily for us consumers though. it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces. the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones. it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central vh1 and country music tv on its devices. and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices. but the ability to record directly from tv vcr and digital cable and satellite boxes which windows-based devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too. the increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them. recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. only 13% of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices. this year we are ready for an explosion of portable media microsoft s mike coleman told the bbc news website. we are very bullish about it. the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer he added. the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. although microsoft s content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment talks were always on-going with european content suppliers to offer similar services. various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. ces which runs from 6 to 9 january showcases more than 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.klinsmann issues lehmann warning germany coach jurgen klinsmann has warned goalkeeper jens lehmann he may have to quit arsenal to keep his world cup dreams alive. lehmann is understudy to oliver kahn in the german squad but has lost his place to manuel alumnia at highbury. klinsmann said: it will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club. if jens is not arsenal s number one keeper that is a problem for me. he must be playing regularly. lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the germany squad when the country hosts the world cup in 2006. klinsmann added: if he is not playing regularly he cannot be germany s number one keeper or even number two keeper. the situation for jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at arsenal. this could be critical if it remains the same during next season.terror detainees win lords appeal detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws the uk s highest court has ruled. in a blow to the government s anti-terror measures the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. most of the men are being indefinitely held in belmarsh prison south london. the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws. the men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. the ruling creates a major problem for charles clarke on his first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation. the liberal democrats say mr clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor david blunkett. belmarsh prison has been dubbed britain s guantanamo bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. however those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said: indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. it deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford. he said the weakness for the government s case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for british suspects. lord hoffmann said: the real threat to the life of the nation in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these. but lord walker of gestingthorpe the one law lord to oppose the appeal said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression. in a statement detainee a in woodhill prison said: i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal law and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones. the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. ben emmerson qc representing seven of the detainees said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. he said they had been given no idea when if ever they would be released had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. when the men were first held they took their cases to the special immigration appeals commission (siac). the commission ruled on 30 july 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as british people could not be held in the same way. but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.palace threat over cantona masks manchester united fans wearing eric cantona masks will not be allowed in selhurst park on saturday. united fans are planning to mark the 10th anniversary of cantona s infamous kung-fu kick on crystal palace fan matthew simmons by wearing the masks. but palace stadium manager kevin corner has warned: if they wear them inside selhurst park they will be immediately rejected on safety grounds. and no fans wearing cantona masks will be allowed entry to the stadium. united fans had declared saturday as cantona day and had planned to wear masks that were popular during the frenchman s time as a player at the old trafford club. cantona received a nine-month ban following the incident and palace are keen to avoid an incident that would stir up ill feeling between the two sets of supporters. four months after the cantona incident a palace fan paul nixon was killed prior to an fa cup semi-final at villa park.battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy. the greenback hit $1.3516 in thin new york trade before rallying to $1.3509. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $1.20 amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile france s finance minister has said the world faced economic catastrophe unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of g7 countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. it s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the g7 our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level said mr gaymard. thursday s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12% in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just 0.2% last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters. the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from abnormal and dangerous heights set in 2002. the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar s strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further albeit less dramatic weakening in 2005. i can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005 finishing the year around $1.40 said adrian hughes currency strategist with hsbc in london.us economy still growing says fed most areas of the us saw their economy continue to expand in december and early january the us federal reserve said in its latest beige book report. of the 12 us regions it identifies for the study 11 showed stronger economic growth with only the cleveland area falling behind with a mixed rating. consumer spending was higher in december than november and festive sales were also up on 2003. the employment picture also improved the fed said. labour markets firmed in a number of districts but wage pressures generally remained modest the beige book said. several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels. the report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. office leasing was especially brisk in washington dc and new york city two of the nation s strongest commercial markets the fed said.desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday. the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000. things will be totally different this time he told bbc sport. now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona. chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1 courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg going down to strikes from rivaldo (2) luis figo dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team who are top of the premiership. mentally they are much stronger even though a lot of their players are young the 36-year-old said. we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality. world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman the manager and all the players he said. everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. since that game in 2000 chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season. desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar alongside the likes of frank lebeouf josep guardiola titi camara gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. i m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level he said. i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays i will continue to play. and it s amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.survey confirms property slowdown government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the uk s housing market in late 2004. house prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004 down from 16.3% in the july-to-september quarter the land registry said. the average house price in england and wales was £182 920 down from £187 971 in july-september. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. the government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. land registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies since they record completions not mortgage approvals. however the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions including cash sales. the cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004. the biggest annual gains were made in wales where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. house prices rose the slowest in greater london being up by 6%. in the capital the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36 185 in 2003 to 28 041 for the same period in 2004. there was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital with 436 properties over £1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. although the figures point to a slowdown in the market the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back end of 2004 halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in january and nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. members of the bank of england s rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on thursday.halo fans hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic halo centred the action on a human cyborg controlled by the player who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven s ringworld and the film starship troopers it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive had tremendous audio using dolby digital a decent storyline instant playability and impressive physics. but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming. produced by bungie software renowned for their innovation in gaming it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera editor of fansite halo.bungie.org said: bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be. he added: graphically it was superior to everything else out there. it also had a depth to it that made it stand out. halo was unusually immersive sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time. the game instantly cultivated an online following which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website which attracts 600 000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news. when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. halo is the most important launch game for any console ever wrote the influential edge magazine in its review giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun said errera remarking on the level of detail in the game. the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo said errera referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game s amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft s history. we re all just hoping that bungie has got it right again. halo 2 is out on 9 november in the us and 11 november in the ukbank holds interest rate at 4.75% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75% in a widely-predicted move. rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence. rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade. today s no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending. mr frost added: the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably. cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said. interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time. on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley. however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates. some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors. a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software. a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini. iaea inspectors make around 3 000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility. the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant. where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman. computer specialist at the iaea peter smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector s toolkit. the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world he said. if we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look. and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem. the iaea estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. so far it has only received $11m from the us and the uk. failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks said an agency statement.deutsche telekom sees mobile gain german telecoms firm deutsche telekom saw strong fourth quarter profits on the back of upbeat us mobile earnings and better-than-expected asset sales. net profit came in at 1.4bn euros (£960m; $1.85bn) a dramatic change from the loss of 364m euros in 2003. sales rose 2.8% to 14.96bn euros. sales of stakes in firms including russia s oao mobile telesystems raised 1.17bn euros. this was more than expected and helped to bring debt down to 35.8bn euros. a year ago debt was more than 11bn euros higher. t-mobile usa the company s american mobile business made a strong contribution to profits. it s a seminal achievement that they cut debt so low. that gives them some head room to invest in growth now said hannes wittig telecoms analyst at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein. the company also said it would resume paying a dividend after two years in which it focused on cutting debt.online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research (ippr). existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate. in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website. a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion. the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues. but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online. at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies. but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities. the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules. e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues. with 53% of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy. government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non-market interactions said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added. the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down. there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation he said. but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc) the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said. in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said: i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending. director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said.macy s owner buys rival for $11bn us retail giant federated department stores is to buy rival may department stores for $11bn (£5.7bn). the deal will bring together famous stores like macy s bloomingdale s and marshall field s creating the largest department store chain in the us. the combined firm will operate about 1 000 stores across the us with combined annual sales of $30bn. the two companies facing competition from the likes of wal-mart tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after may s chairman and chief executive gene kahn resigned in january. as part of the deal federated - owner of macy s and bloomingdale s - will assume $6bn of may s debt bringing the deal s total value to $17bn. directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year. may has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as federated and other retailers such as wal-mart. federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges. we have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in america creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence said terry lundgren federated s chairman. some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for may. without this deal may would have been to put it bluntly washed up said kurt barnard president of barnard s retail consulting group. federated has annual sales of $15.6bn while may s yearly sales are $14.4bn.xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer details of the next generation of microsoft s xbox games console - codenamed xenon - will most likely be unveiled in may according to reports. it was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of xbox s successor at the game developers conference (gdc) in march. but a microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at gdc. sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. the next xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year but very few details about it have been released. it is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the electronic entertainment expo (e3) in los angeles which takes place in may according to a reuters news agency report. e3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers marketers and retailers. the gdc is aimed more at game developers. microsoft chief bill gates used the gdc event to unveil the original xbox five years ago. since its launch microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide. at the consumer electronics show earlier this year there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. in his keynote speech mr gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. but the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its playstation 2. but earlier this year microsoft said it had reached a european milestone selling five million consoles since its european launch in march 2002. hit games like halo 2 which was released in november helped to buoy the sales figures. gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power. they are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. although details of playstation 3 xenon and nintendo s so-called revolution are yet to be finalised developers are already working on titles. rory armes studio general manager for games giant electronic arts (ea) in europe recently told the bbc news website in an interview that ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo s kits. but he added the playstation 3 was rumoured to have a little more under the hood [than xbox 2] .yachvili savours france comeback france scrum-half dimitri yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat england 18-17 in the six nations clash at twickenham. yachvili kicked all of france s points as they staged a second-half revival. we didn t play last week against scotland and we didn t play in the first half against england he said. but we re very proud to beat england at twickenham. we were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure. we did well. yachvili admitted erratic kicking from england s charlie hodgson and olly barkley who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them had been decisive. i know what it s like with kicking. when you miss some it s very hard mentally but it went well for us he said. france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since 1997. france were 17-6 down at half-time but pelous said: no-one was down at half-time we were still confident. we said we only had 11 points against us which was not much. the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure. france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well. we know we have to play better to defend the title he said. i m not happy we didn t score a try but we re happy because we won.kraft cuts snack ads for children kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like oreo cookies and sugary kool-aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating. the largest us food maker will also add a label to its more nutritional and low-fat brands to promote the benefits. kraft rival pepsico began a similar labelling initiative last year. the moves come as the firms face criticism from consumer groups concerned at rising levels of obesity in us children. major food manufacturers have recently been reformulating the content of some calorie-heavy products. kraft s new advertising policy which covers advertising on tv radio and in print publications is aimed at children between the ages of six and 11. it means commercials for some of its most famous snacks and cereals shown during early morning cartoon shows on tv will now be replaced by food and drink qualifying for kraft s new sensible solution label. but the firm said it would continue to advertise all its products in media seen by parents and all family audiences. we re working on ways to encourage both adults and children to eat wisely by selecting more nutritionally balanced diets said lance friedmann kraft senior vice president.cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy. all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s convertible peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression . the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said. the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may. cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital. it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue. the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money known as remittances can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there. cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth $3bn to the country. the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however a decline in foreign tourism since 2002 periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said. the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.mirza makes indian tennis history teenager sania mirza completed a superb week at the hyderabad open by becoming the first indian in history to win a wta singles title. in front of a delirious home crowd the 18-year-old battled past alyona bondarenko of the ukraine 6-4 5-7 6-3. mirza ranked 134 in the world sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against bondarenko. it is a big moment in my career and i would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my effort she said. this win has made me believe more in myself and i can now hope to do better in the coming days. i wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown. at the australian open in january mirza became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam before losing to eventual champion serena williams. and a year ago she became the youngest indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the hyderabad open. mirza playing in her first wta final began nervously in front of a raucous home crowd - committing three double faults in her opening service game. but from 0-2 down mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set. in a see-saw second set bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though mirza hauled herself level the ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. at 5-3 the stadium erupted in celebration when mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd she broke bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.chip maker backs net phone calls rich templeton the head of giant chip maker texas instruments has given his backing to the growing sector of voice over internet telephony (voip) voip allows pc users and in some cases those with just a broadband connection to make telephone calls via the net. mr templeton said voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. internet service provider wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the uk. subscribers to wanadoo s broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any uk landline and free calls at any time to other wanadoo users. the service will cost an extra £4 a month and will come with a free livebox the broadband hub which wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. the secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. eventually the service will replace existing landline services as wanadoo goes head to head with bt. voice-over broadband is a key trend across europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry eric abensur wanadoo s chief executive told the bbc news website. mr templeton said he agreed. voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access he said. the world s largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently. almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the skype voip service according to the net telephony firm s website. skype lets people make free calls to other skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. us firm vonage also offers a voip service but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. bill simmelink general manager of ti s voip business said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. it s not about the pipe if you will or the silicon per se it s about the application he said. we want to communicate freely effortlessly and economically wherever we are. in a sign that voip is seeping into the mainstream giant isp aol announced on tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. customers will continue to use their traditional phones but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. we can help mass-market adoption of voip said aol chief executive jonathan miller. we can utilise our national footprint. we can help the entire industry become well known.industrial revival hope for japan japanese industry is growing faster than expected boosting hopes that the country s retreat back into recession is over. industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in january from a month earlier. at the same time retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. the news sent tokyo shares to an eight-month high as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from april 2004 on. the nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11 740.60 points with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. weaker exports normally the engine for japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking gdp. only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying. within the overall industrial output figure there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars chemicals and electronic goods. with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market with products such as flat-screen tvs in high demand during january.fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have severe consequences. speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit such as increasing taxes. while the us economy is growing at a reasonably good pace he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us. pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy he said. the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. if existing promises need to be changed those changes should be made sooner rather than later mr greenspan said. he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity retirement and health programmes would need significant changes. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford. meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending he added. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. despite the dire warnings mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely which should cut some costs. since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.asian quake hits european shares shares in europe s leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south asia has become apparent. more than 23 000 people have been killed following a massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations. reisurance firms such as swiss re and munich re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. but the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the us and asia. currencies including the thai baht and indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. it came at the worst possible time said hans goetti a singapore-based fund manager. the impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating especially in thailand. travel-related shares dropped in europe with companies such as germany s tui and lufthansa and france s club mediterranne sliding. insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in europe. shares in munich re and swiss re - the world s two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in asia. zurich financial allianz and axa also suffered a decline in value. however their losses were much smaller reflecting the market s view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged european shares down although the impact was exacerbated by light post-christmas trading. germany s benchmark dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while france s cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. investors pointed out however that declines probably would be industry specific with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. it s still too early for concrete damage figures swiss re s spokesman floiran woest told associated press. that also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically. the unfolding scale of the disaster in south asia had little immediate impact on us shares however. the dow jones index had risen 20.54 points or 0.2% to 10 847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-christmas sales. in asian markets adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. thai airways shed almost 4%. the country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. singapore airlines dropped 2.6%. about 5% of singapore s annual gross domestic product (gdp) comes from tourism. malaysia s budget airline airasia fell 2.9%. resort operator tanco holdings slumped 5%. travel companies also took a hit with japan s kinki nippon sliding 1.5% and his dropping 3.3%. however the overall impact on asia s largest stock market japan s nikkei was slight. shares fell just 0.03%. concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. the indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the us dollar before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9 300. the thai baht lost 0.3% against the us currency trading at 39.10. in india where more than 2 000 people are thought to have died the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.india power shares jump on debut shares in india s largest power producer national thermal power corp (ntpc) have risen 13% on their stock market debut. the government s partial sell-off of ntpc is part of a controversial programme to privatise state-run firms. the 865 million share offer a mix of new shares and sales by the government raised 54bn rupees($1.2bn). it was india s second $1bn stock debut in three months coming after the flotation by software firm tata. the share offer was eleven times oversubscribed. it is a good investment bet said suhas naik an investment analyst from ing mutual fund. power needs in india are set to rise and ntpc will benefit from that. analysts say the success of the ntpc flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies. ntpc has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country s energy-starved economy. the firm is the largest utility company in india and the sixth largest power producer in the world.reliance unit loses anil ambani anil ambani the younger of the two brothers in charge of india s largest private company has resigned from running its petrochemicals subsidiary. the move is likely to be seen as the latest twist in a feud between mr ambani and his brother mukesh. anil 45 has stepped down as director and vice-chairman of indian petrochemicals corporation (ipc). the company was not available for comment. ipc is 46%-owned by reliance industries which in turn is run by mukesh. mukesh has spoken of ownership issues between the two brothers who took over control of the reliance empire following the death of their father in july 2002. reliance s operations have massive reach covering textiles telecommunications petrochemicals petroleum refining and marketing as well as oil and gas exploration insurance and financial services. the brothers spat has hogged headlines in india during recent weeks despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong. speculation has been rife about what has triggered the stand-off with some observers blaming anil s political ambitions others the heavy investment by mukesh and reliance in a mobile phone venture. shares of ipc dipped on the news in mumbai but recovered to trade almost 6% higher. reliance shares added 1.7% while reliance energy headed by anil jumped 7%.sony psp tipped as a must-have sony s playstation portable is the top gadget for 2005 according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by stuff magazine. it beats the ipod into second place in the top ten essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back £7 455. that is £1 000 cheaper than last year s list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable. portable gadgets dominate the list including sharp s 902 3g mobile phone the pentax optio sv digital camera and samsung s yepp yh-999 video jukebox. what this year s essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper sexier and more indispensable than ever. we ve got to the point where we can t live our lives without certain technology said adam vaughan editor of stuff essentials. the proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks mr vaughan. take digital cameras who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos or legitimate downloads who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p he asks. next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers stuff predicts. the xbox 2 high-definition tv and mp3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006 it says. the spring launch of the psp in the uk is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.paraguay novel wins us book prize a novel set in 19th century paraguay has won the $10 000 (£5 390) fiction prize at the us national book awards. lily tuck s the news from paraguay is a fictionalised tale about paraguayan leader francisco solano lopez and his irish mistress. but the annual awards which were presented in new york on wednesday were not without controversy. children s author judy blume who was given an honourary medal used the ceremony to speak out over censorship. sales of blume s books have exceeded 75 million but her work - which features frank narratives about families religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors. blume said: the urge to ban is contagious. it spreads like wildfire from community to community. please speak out. censors hate publicity. her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness. last year s honorary winner stephen king accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. but his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone. this year s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as philip roth s the plot against america and instead chose five little-known books all by new york-based women. one fiction judge stewart o nan carried around a note written on a napkin that said: i would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books not an enemy. the national book awards non-fiction prize was awarded to kevin boyle s for arc of justice which focuses on a black family s fight to live in a white detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. the award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 commission report looking into the events of the 11 september terrorist attacks on the us. pete hautman won the young people s literature prize for his novel godless. the winner in the poetry category was jean valentine for door in the mountain: new and collected poems 1965-2003.yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. the firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas. the unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. the company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets using all and every legal means. the company wants damages of $20bn claiming yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. judge letitia clark will hear different motions including one from deutsche bank to throw out the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. the german lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to gazprom the russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank which is also an advisor to gazprom has called on the us court to overturn its decision to provide yukos with bankruptcy protection. lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify deutsche bank s business position analysts said. analysts are not optimistic about yukos chances in court. russian president vladimir putin and the country s legal authorities have repeatedly said that the us has no jurisdiction over yukos and its legal wranglings. on top of that the firm only has limited assets in the us. yukos has won small victories however and is bullish about its chances in court. do we have an ability to influence what happens we think we do said mike lake a yukos spokesman. the litigation risks are real said credit suisse first boston analyst vadim mitroshin the dispute with the russian authorities is partly driven by president putin s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.brookside actress keaveney dies actress anna keaveney who appeared in brookside my family and a touch of frost has died of lung cancer aged 55. keaveney who played brookside s marie jackson when the channel 4 soap began in 1982 died on saturday. born in runcorn cheshire she also starred in numerous films including 1989 s shirley valentine. she played nellie in mike leigh s latest film vera drake which won the golden lion prize for best film at this year s venice film festival. and most recently she appeared alongside richard wilson in itv s king of fridges and with martin clunes in doc martin. other tv appearances included the part of matron in itv drama footballers wives and a cameo role as tom farrell s mother sheila in bbc comedy gimme gimme gimme. keaveney s career also included stage performances in neaptide for the national theatre private lives and the rise and fall of little voice. the actress died in hospital. her agent barry brown said: anna was due to have had another operation on friday but unfortunately she was too weak.could yukos be a blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business. but in the looking-glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report* has argued. the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police. an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say. the paper s reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness. after vladimir putin became president in 2000 he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort - too much critics argue - into enforcement. since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4% and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers. does this analysis make sense in part certainly. for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes. and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.profits stall at china s lenovo profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition. the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm. lenovo s profit for the three months to december was hk$327m (us$42m; £22m) less than 1% up on the year before. chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years but are now growing more slowly. the company is still by far the biggest player in china with more than a quarter of the market. but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china and lenovo s sales were down 3.7% by revenue to hk$6.31bn. if the $1.75bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through it will mark the end of an era. ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. in any case margins in pc market are now wafer thin and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell. but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo s move designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage. its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage. the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo s shares up 6% in late january.voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. nominations were announced on sunday but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories from the top regional blog to the best-kept-secret blog. blogs had a huge year with a top us dictionary naming blog word of 2004. technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12 000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds according to us research think-tank pew internet and american life but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. nikolai nolan who has run the bloggies for the past five years told the bbc news website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. the awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit so i had to guess how much i d need he said. there were many new finalists this year he added and a few that had won bloggies before. several entries reflected specific news events. there are four nominations for the south-east asia earthquake and tsunami blog which is a pretty timely one for 2005 said mr nolan. the big bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. the nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. fighting it out for the coveted award are gawker this fish needs a bicycle wonkette boing boing and gothamist. in a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs the south-east asia earthquake and tsunami blog is also nominated in the best overall category. greenfairydotcom londonist hicksdesign plasticbag and london underground tube blog are the nominees in the best british or irish weblog. included in the other categories is best meme . this is for the top replicating idea that spread about weblogs . nominations include flickr a web photo album which lets people upload tag share and publish their images to blogs. podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. it is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of rss (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows and distribute them automatically onto portable devices. many are done by those who already have text-based blogs so they are almost like audio blogs. three new categories have been added to the list this year including best food best entertainment and best writing of a weblog. one of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. the winners of the fifth annual bloggies are chosen by the public. public voting closes on 3 february and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 march.escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded. michael ferguson 36 escaped after being allowed out of the high-security carstairs unit. the snp s nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave. the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval. an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister. ms brankin said: the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this. ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety. police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday. the scottish national party s parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of ferguson s leave of absence would have come directly from ministers. she said: the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs. however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers. she added: i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact. i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on. this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases. police said ferguson posed a danger to the public. bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. he said: we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs. the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it. but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised. scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen . the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers . she said: ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision. ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in 1994 had been out to see his fianc&#233;e annabella holmes 47 whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire. he is described as being 5ft 9ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion. ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen. he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye. ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday. strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on .smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper. those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610 s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones. the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip. once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.format wars could confuse users technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium. the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. the difference is that it is very fragmented he said. it s not a two-horse race it s a five six seven or even eight-horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come. shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this she said. although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said. she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now 230 according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats. it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest. ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. people want portability she said and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability. cory doctorow european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on.abortion not a poll issue - blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue arguing it is a matter for individual conscience. the prime minister s spokesman set out mr blair s view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard s stance on abortions. the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand . the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law. mr blair s spokesman said: the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context. his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o connor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howard s stance and distanced himself from labour. in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue saying: the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion. cardinal o connor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said: we are not going to suggest people support one particular party. the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. more than 180 000 women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks. in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said: i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed. in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20. all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp s conscience rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. mr howard stressed his views were his personal views. shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue. mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazine s high heeled vote campaign. mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue . however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice. obviously there is a time beyond which you can t have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue. mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean i don t know what i would do now . the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting. anne weyman chief executive of the family planning association asked: what is the benefit to women or to the potential child of forcing a woman to have a baby anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance congratulated mr howard on his new stance but said it did not go far enough.insurance bosses plead guilty another three us insurance executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from an ongoing investigation into industry malpractice. two executives from american international group (aig) and one from marsh & mclennan were the latest. the investigation by new york attorney general eliot spitzer has now obtained nine guilty pleas. the highest ranking executive pleading guilty on tuesday was former marsh senior vice president joshua bewlay. he admitted one felony count of scheming to defraud and faces up to four years in prison. a marsh spokeswoman said mr bewlay was no longer with the company. mr spitzer s investigation of the us insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices. last month marsh agreed to pay $850m (£415m) to settle a lawsuit filed by mr spitzer but under the settlement it neither admits nor denies the allegations .turkey deal to help world peace a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world tony blair has said. the deal struck at the european council last week also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were wrong mr blair said. it represented the achievement of an historic british objective he added. tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was anti-islamic . turkey s involvement with the eu would provide an invaluable bridge between europe and the rest of the world mr howard added. but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed. if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware. the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool. the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft s windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100 000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers often without users knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and on average each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec mcafee trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft s two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.potter director signs warner deal harry potter director alfonso cuaron has signed a three-year deal with hollywood studio warner brothers according to variety trade magazine. the mexican film-maker who directed harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban will produce mainstream movies and smaller spanish-language films. we had a wonderful experience with alfonso on harry potter warner producer jeff robinov told variety. cuaron s other films include mexican movie y tu mama tambien. the 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman brought cuaron international attention - and box office glory. it also won him and his brother carlos with whom he co-wrote the screenplay an oscar nomination for best original screenplay. warner will distribute cuaron s films in several languages outside the us. this deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully said mr robinov. his first film for warner brothers was 1995 s family fantasy movie a little princess. based on the novel by frances hodgson burnett a little princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a new york boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. after the erotic nature of y tu mama tambien cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third harry potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.zambia confident and cautious zambia s technical director kalusha bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the cosafa cup final against angola on saturday in lusaka. bwalya said: nothing short of victory will do. however bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent. i don t want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game. for me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win. zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players. however the 41 year-old bwalya who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against mauritius is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not. the chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a victory concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country s top musicians. both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time and so keep the trophy for good. the chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for southern african nations in 1997 and 1998. they were prevented from a third straight win by angola who knocked out the zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999. that victory for angola also marked a first defeat in 14 years for zambia at lusaka s independence stadium where saturday s game is being played. angola named just four overseas-based players in their preliminary squad. the palancas negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their portugal-based players.bombardier chief to leave company shares in train and plane-making giant bombardier have fallen to a 10-year low following the departure of its chief executive and two members of the board. paul tellier who was also bombardier s president left the company amid an ongoing restructuring. laurent beaudoin part of the family that controls the montreal-based firm will take on the role of ceo under a newly created management structure. analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. under mr tellier s tenure at the company which began in january 2003 plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75 000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced. the firm s snowmobile division and defence services unit were also sold and bombardier started the development of a new aircraft seating 110 to 135 passengers. mr tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world s top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. but bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (£19.2m) in the third quarter down from a profit of $133m a year ago. i understand the board s concern that i would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies and the need to reshape the management structure at this time mr tellier said in a statement on monday. bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by mr tellier s would continue to be implemented. shares in bombardier lost 65 canadian cents or 25% on the news to 1.90 canadian dollars before rallying to 2.20 canadian dollars.nintendo adds media playing to ds nintendo is releasing an adapter for its ds handheld console so it can play music and video. the add-on for the ds means people can download tv programmes film clips or mp3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. the release of the media add-on is an attempt by the japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. nintendo said the media adapter will be available from february in japan. the nintendo ds is the successor to the hugely successful gameboy handheld game console and went on sale in japan on 2 december. the ds has two screens one of which is touch sensitive and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other. the launch of the media adapter and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the sony psp which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the psp. the add-on will also work with the gameboy advance sp. nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the gameboy. more than 28 million gameboy advance handhelds have been sold around the world. the dual-screen ds is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside japan. when it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (£25) roughly the difference in price between the ds and the higher-priced sony psp.us ahold suppliers face charges us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (£428m). the charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies alleging they created false accounts. ahold hit the headlines in february 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice. three former ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges. ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at foodservice improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities. the nine now charged who worked as suppliers to ahold are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings. us attorney david kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. he added that there may be more court actions in the future. i don t want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved he said. among those facing charges are john nettle a former employee of general mills; mark bailin of rymer international seafood; tim daly of michael foods and kenneth bowman who worked as an independent contractor for total foods. others include michael hannigan of sugar foods; peter marion of maritime seafood processors and first choice foods; gordon redgate of commodity manager and private label distribution; bruce robinson of basic american foods and michael rogers formerly of tyson foods. pasquale d amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in the process of cooking the books at ahold. at the time of the scandal ahold was seen by many as europe s enron. ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across europe. it was less severe than many had envisaged however and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. ahold is the world s fourth-largest supermarket chain. its other us businesses include stop & shop and giant food.man auctions ad space on forehead a 20-year-old us man is selling advertising space on his forehead to the highest bidder on website ebay. andrew fisher from omaha nebraska said he would have a non-permanent logo or brand name tattooed on his head for 30 days. the way i see it i m selling something i already own; after 30 days i get it back he told the bbc today programme. mr fisher has received 39 bids so far with the largest bid currently at more than $322 (£171). the winner will be able to send me a tattoo or have me go to a tattoo parlour and get a temporary ink tattoo on my forehead and this will be something they choose a company name or domain name perhaps their logo he told the radio 4 programme. on the online auction mr fisher describes himself as an average american joe give or take . his sales pitch adds: take advantage of this radical advertising campaign and become a part of history. mr fisher said that while he would accept any brand name or logo i wouldn t go around with a swastika or anything racial . he added: i wouldn t go around with 666 the mark of the beast. other than that i wouldn t promote anything socially unacceptable such as adult websites or stores. he said he would use the money to pay college - he is planning to study graphic design. the entrepreneur said his mother was initially surprised by his decision but following all the media attention she felt he was thinking outside the box .india and iran in gas export deal india has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from iran. firms led by the oil & natural gas corporation (ongc) will also assist in the development of iranian oil fields. ministers eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy secured a similar deal to one between iran and china. the announcement comes as ongc said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled russian oil firm yukos. the agreements with iran were sealed after talks in new delhi between middle east producers and asia s biggest energy consumers - china india japan and south korea. iran - opec s second-biggest oil producer and one of the world s top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals rewarding lng buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. under the agreement it will supply india with 7.5 million tonnes of lpg annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ongc and the national iranian oil company (nioc) reached a preliminary deal for indian firms to take part in the development of the yadavaran and jufeyr oilfields both countries said in a statement. india s oil production has stagnated over recent years and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day compared with 474 000 bpd in 1973.european losses hit gm s profits general motors (gm) saw its net profits fall 37% in the last quarter of 2004 as it continued to be hit by losses at its european operations. the us giant earned $630m (£481.5m) in the october-to-december period down from $1bn in the fourth quarter of 2003. gm s revenues rose 4.7% to $51.2bn from $48.8bn a year earlier. the fourth-quarter losses at general motors europe totalled $345m up from $66m during the same period in 2003. gm s main european brands are opel and vauxhall. excluding special items gm s global income from continuing operations totalled $569m during the quarter down from $838m a year earlier. the results were in line with wall street expectations and shares in gm rose by about 1% in pre-market trade. for the whole of 2004 gm earned $3.7bn down from $3.8bn in 2003 while its annual revenue rose 4.5% to $193bn. gm said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the us. gm reported solid overall results in 2004 despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe gm chairman and chief executive rick wagoner said in a statement. the company recently announced that it expected profits in 2005 to be lower than in 2004.seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture name and personal details the new seafarers identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenti-corp s ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.boeing secures giant japan order boeing is to supply japan airlines with up to 50 of its forthcoming 7e7 planes in a deal that could be worth as much as $6bn (£3.1bn) for the us giant. japan airlines has made a firm order for 30 of the aircraft at $120m each with the option to buy 20 more. asia s biggest airline joins japanese rival all nippon as one of the first carriers to order the mid-size 7e7 which boeing says is super-economical. airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7e7 rival - the a350. boeing s great european competitor is to sell 10 of its forthcoming a350 to spanish carrier air europe which has the option to buy two more in a deal that could be worth more than $1.8bn. both the 7e7 and the a350 are being designed to be as fuel-efficient as possible in the 200- to 300-seat sector and each will be available in both short and long range versions. japan airlines said it had looked at both aircraft before choosing the 7e7 also known as the dreamliner. we chose the 7e7 after carefully considering both it and airbus aircraft said a japan airlines spokesman. the 7e7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it. boeing continues to enjoy a dominance over airbus in japan and japanese companies are taking key roles in building the 7e7. the first 7e7s will be delivered to japan airlines in april 2008. boeing has set itself a target of getting 200 firm commitments for the 7e7 by the end of this year and has orders for 56 so far. airbus hopes to have 50 orders in place for the a350 by mid-2005.yangtze electric s profits double yangtze electric power the operator of china s three gorges dam has said its profits more than doubled in 2004. the firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. as a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; £190m) compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. sales surged to 6.2bn yuan from 3bn yuan a year earlier. the figures topped analysts expectations even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%. yangtze electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by china s booming economy. the government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat. that has led to an energy crunch with demand outstripping supply. earlier this month work was halted on an underground power station and a supply unit on the three gorges dam as well as a power station on its sister xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. a total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons. the three gorges dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. its sister project the xiluodu dam is being built on the jinshajiang - or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known.goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials. lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice saying such papers are always kept confidential. in a statement lord goldsmith said: i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised and of course approved the answer. he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman two of his own officials three foreign office officials a qc christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor lord irvine of lairg. no other minister or official was involved in any way. he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence. as i have always made clear i set out in the answer my own genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions he said. the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government. former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled. the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary but others certainly did he said. what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full accurate summary of his formal opinion. earlier tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion. that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential tory mp michael mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry told the bbc: that as a general rule is right but it s not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added: this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues. if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march he said. only the fullest disclosure will now do.what price for trusted pc security you can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the pc vendors asks technology analyst bill thompson. if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer a dell optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba hp/compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys. but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. and as part of a well-designed network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based. at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. it might be password-protected user accounts data encryption programs or a firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. hardware security is less common even if it is a lot safer. this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers. as a result we settle for second best. so when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be a major step forward. after all if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. instead you have to use special software like hp s protecttools or wave systems embassy. this provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks. full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn . this will include what microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism calls the next generation secure computing base and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide. because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (drm) systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them. we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. users of apple s itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection. but the latest version of itunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd. another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real s harmony service on your ipod. apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software and the users cannot control it. one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. once it is unlocked then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services finding business models that are based on trusting your customers and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends record shows i want to watch later and burn cds for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.new year s texting breaks record a mobile phone was as essential to the recent new year s festivities as a party mood and auld lang syne if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by. between midnight on 31 december and midnight on 1 january 133m text messages were sent in the uk. it is the highest ever daily total recorded by the mobile data association (mda). it represents an increase of 20% on last year s figures. wishing a happy new year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year s largest party. while texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call it is heading that way said mike short chairman of the mda. in the case of a new years eve party texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background he said. there were also lots of messages sent internationally where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible he said. the british love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn according to mda. the mda predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the uk. we thought texting might slow down as mms took off but we have seen no sign of that said mr short. more and more firms are seeing the value in mobile marketing. restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions. anyone in need of a bit of january cheer now the party season is over can use a service set up by jongleurs comedy club which will text them a joke a day. for those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in the good pub guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub. users need to text the word goodpub to 85130. if they want to turn the evening into a pub crawl they simply text the word next. and for those still standing at the end of the night a taxi service in london is available via text which will locate the nearest available black cab.\n",
